I	O
experienced	O
lightheadedness,	O
depression,	O
short	O

problems.	O
The	O
worst	O
side	O
effects	O
by	O
far	O
were	O
the	O
severe	O
muscle	O
pains	O
and	O
cramps,	O
especially	O
in	O
my	O
shins,	O
front	O
of	O
my	O
thighs,	O
feet	O
and	O
hands.	O
I	O
noticed	O
that	O
they	O
usually	O
began	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
taking	O
the	O
Lipitor	O
and	O
would	O
continue	O
for	O
several	O
hours	O
into	O
the	O
night.	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
Lipitor	O
2	O
years	O
when	O
I	O
noticed	O
that	O
on	O
a	O
day	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
forgotten	O
to	O
take	O
it,	O
that	O
I	O
didn't	O
experience	O
the	O
severe	O
pains.	O
I	O
experimented	O
by	O
taking	O
the	O
medication	O
one	O
night	O
and	O
then	O
not	O
taking	O
it	O
the	O
next.	O
Sure	O
enough,	O
every	O
night	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
medication	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
severe	O
cramps/pains	O
but	O
the	O
nights	O
I	O
didn't	O
take	O
it,	O
either	O
I	O
didn't	O
experience	O
the	O
pain	O
at	O
all	O
or	O
it	O
was	O
at	O
a	O
much	O
lesser	O
degree.	O
After	O
a	O
few	O
days,	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor	O
for	O
a	O
2	O
week	O
period	O
and	O
noticed	O
that	O
all	O
my	O
symptoms	O
improved	O
and	O
the	O
muscle	O
pains	O
and	O
cramps	O
completely	O
resolved.	O
I	O
notified	O
my	O
doctor.	O
She	O
stopped	O
the	O
Lipitor	O
and	O
suggested	O
that	O
I	O
try	O

A	O

the	O

I	O
listed	O
(mostly	O

quickly	O
appeared	O
when	O
I	O
began	O
the	O
Lipitor	O
and	O
became	O

and	O
more	O
of	O

the	O

out	O

I	O

My	O

in	O
my	O
opinion	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
side	O

was	O
not	O
taken	O
very	O
seriously.	O
It	O

3	O
months	O

Have	O

even	O
though	O
I	O
have	O

had	O

especially	O
in	O
the	O
leg/calf	O
area	O
and	O
the	O
lower	O

Originaly	O
thought	O
that	O
the	O
pain	O
might	O
be	O
caused	O
from	O
a	O
slip	O
disc	O
that	O
I	O
have,	O
but	O
the	O
pain	O
is	O
different	O
than	O
experienced	O
before.	O
After	O
reading	O
all	O
the	O
ratings	O
on	O
thib	O

I'm	O
convinced	O
that	O
the	O
new	O
pain/weight	O
gain/fatigue	O
and	O
general	O
not	O
feeling.	O

Exhaustion	O
after	O
exercise	O
such	O
as	O
skiing	O
or	O

Heavy	O

It	O
works	O
for	O

levels,	O
but	O
after	O
6	O
years	O
I'm	O
increasingly	O
wondering	O
about	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
and	O
looking	O
for	O
alternatives.	O

I	O
experienced	O
severe	O
pain	O
in	O
my	O

Unable	O

I	O

an	O

and	O
cannot	O
see	O
anything	O
on	O
them.	O
He	O
diagnosed	O
it	O
as	O
frozen	O

Funny,	O
that	O
it	O
only	O
began	O
when	O
I	O
started	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
took	O
myself	O

I'll	O

before	O
the	O
two	O

What	O
I	O
am	O
reading	O
is	O
that	O
most	O

are	O
NOT	O

-	O
maybe	O
take	O
that	O
back	O

So	O
I	O
am	O
here	O
looking	O
for	O

about	O
the	O
side	O

-	O
anecdotally	O
presented	O
-	O
as	O
the	O

for	O
Lipitor	O
does	O
not	O
have	O
the	O

that	O
would	O
typically	O
come	O
on	O
the	O

If	O
anyone	O
knows	O

I	O
called	O
MD	O
today,	O
he	O
said	O
stop	O
taking	O
lipitor	O
immediately	O
and	O
sent	O
me	O
to	O
lab	O
for	O
blood	O

to	O
determine	O
if	O
any	O
damage	O
done	O
to	O

I	O
wish	O

and	O
feeling	O

Why	O
am	O
I	O
on	O

because	O
the	O
insurance	O

required	O
a	O
trial	O

an	O

Since	O

the	O

go	O
to	O

so	O
they	O
can	O
dictate	O
what	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
on.	O
sorry	O
for	O
the	O
rant.	O

I	O
started	O
to	O
take	O
20	O
mg	O
lipitor	O
in	O
August	O
2006,	O
after	O
6	O
months,	O
I	O
reduced	O
to	O
take	O
10	O
mg,	O
and	O
after	O
another	O
6	O
months,	O
I	O
reduced	O
the	O
lipitor	O
intake	O
to	O
5	O
mg.	O
During	O
all	O
these	O
18	O
months,	O
my	O
LDL	O
and	O
cholesterol	O
in	O
70s	O
and	O
120s	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
feel	O
much	O
side	O
effects.	O
When	O
I	O
incresed	O
lipitor	O
from	O
5	O
mg	O
to	O
10	O
mg	O
about	O
3	O
months	O
ago,	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
experience	O
the	O
following	O
side-effects	O
started	O
at	O
different	O
time:	O
loss	O
body	O
balance,	O
joint	O
pain,	O
muscle	O
aches,	O
weak	O
legs,	O
and	O
some	O
memory	O
loss.	O
About	O
2	O
months	O
ago	O
while	O
I	O
first	O
told	O
my	O
doctor	O
I	O
lost	O
some	O
body	O
balance	O
and	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
due	O
to	O
lipitor	O
buy	O
my	O
doctor	O
told	O
me	O
the	O
side	O
effect	O
was	O
most	O
likely	O
by	O
some	O
other	O
reason(s).	O
During	O
my	O
second	O
visiting	O
him,	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
my	O
blood	O
test	O
CK	O
is	O
90	O
and	O
my	O
muscle	O
should	O
be	O
OK.	O
Then	O
I	O
continued	O
to	O
take	O
10	O
mg	O
lipitor,	O
but	O
I	O
felt	O
more	O
on	O
muscle	O
and	O
joint	O
pain	O
and	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
feel	O
I	O
lost	O
some	O
memory.	O
Therefore,	O
I	O
deeply	O
believed	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
side	O
effects	O
by	O
taking	O
lipitor.	O
After	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
to	O
10	O
day	O
without	O
lipitor,	O
I	O
got	O
my	O
memory	O
back	O
to	O
nomal	O
level	O
and	O
my	O
body	O
balance	O
is	O
getting	O
better.	O
During	O
my	O
third	O
doctor	O
visit,	O
my	O
doctor	O
finally	O
believed	O
that	O
I	O
got	O
bad	O
side	O
effects	O
and	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
it	O
would	O
take	O
months	O
for	O
recovery.	O
Now	O
my	O
doctor	O
wants	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
B3	O
or	O
Niaspan	O
instead	O
of	O
lipitor.	O

I	O
experienced	O
tighening	O
of	O
the	O
chest	O
and	O
leg	O
cramps.	O
I	O
really	O
didn't	O
have	O
a	O
bad	O
reaction	O
to	O
this	O
Medicatiion.	O
I	O
would	O
take	O
this	O

was	O
my	O

Within	O

I	O
had	O

I	O
stopped	O
it	O
8	O

and	O
still	O

will	O

if	O
I	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
poison,	O
some	O
people	O
do	O
need	O
statans	O
I	O
guess,	O
but	O
not	O
me!.	O

It	O
did	O
lower	O
my	O

but	O
I	O
became	O
so	O
depressed	O
that	O
I	O
called	O
my	O
doctor	O
and	O
told	O
her	O
I	O
refused	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
anymore.	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
effect	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
caused	O
by	O
an	O
interaction	O
with	O
the	O
birth	O
control	O
pill.	O
it	O
lowered	O
my	O
numbers,	O
but	O
made	O
my	O
life	O
miserable.	O

extremly	O
bad	O
pains	O
in	O
hands,arms,shoulders.	O
I	O
took	O
lipitor	O
10mg	O
for	O
only	O
about	O
two	O
months,then	O
cardiologist	O
increased	O
it	O
to	O
20mg.	O
In	O
one	O
week	O
i	O
started	O
to	O
get	O
very	O

about	O

of	O
statins,and	O
all	O
was	O
revealed.	O
I	O
told	O
my	O

i	O
would	O
never	O
take	O
statins	O
again.	O
I	O
stopped	O
them	O
about	O
eight	O

have	O
gone	O
from	O

there	O
does	O

I	O
now	O
warn	O
all	O
my	O

about	O

and	O
their	O

too	O
long,	O
mostly	O
due	O
to	O
my	O
inability	O
to	O
make	O
decisions	O
due	O
to	O
statin's	O
brain-draining	O
effects.	O
After	O
nearly	O
committing	O
suicide	O
due	O
to	O
statin-induced	O
depression,	O
I	O
stopped	O
all	O
statin	O
meds.	O
My	O
depression	O
lifted	O
quickly,	O
panic	O
attacks	O
stopped,	O
my	O
hair	O
started	O
growing	O
back.	O
Web	O
searches	O
turned	O
up	O
information	O
indicating	O
that	O
women	O
probably	O
shouldn't	O
be	O
taking	O
statins,	O
especially	O
older	O
women.	O
I'm	O
lucky	O
to	O
be	O
alive	O
and	O
will	O
do	O
everything	O
I	O
can	O
to	O

this	O

My	O
boyfriend	O
is	O
49	O
and	O
has	O
had	O
high	O
cholesterol	O
for	O
about	O
10	O
years.	O
his	O
doctor	O
put	O
him	O
on	O
Lipitor.	O
he	O
took	O
it	O
twice	O
and	O
could	O
hardly	O
stay	O
awake.	O
Also	O
noticed	O
pains	O
in	O
his	O
legs	O
and	O
weakness	O
in	O
his	O
knees	O
after	O
the	O
first	O
dose.	O
He	O
has	O
stopped	O
and	O
will	O
not	O
resume	O
this	O
treatment.	O
There	O
must	O
be	O
a	O
better	O
alternative.	O
Don't	O
do	O
it!	O
There	O
are	O
too	O
many	O

I	O
realize	O
that	O
a	O
knee	O
replacement	O
is	O
inevitable,	O
and	O
I	O
need	O
the	O

but	O
the	O

are	O

Debilitating.	O
Has	O
ruined	O
my	O
life.	O
One	O
year	O
-	O
7	O
different	O
doctors,	O
no	O
one	O
found	O
the	O
problem	O
for	O
an	O
entire	O
year	O
of	O

Now,	O
off	O
drug	O
for	O
one	O
year	O
and	O
STILL	O
have	O
burning,	O
knotting	O
muscles	O
throughout	O
my	O
body.	O
Bottoms	O
of	O
feet	O
hurt	O
and	O
are	O
so	O
tight	O
it's	O
hard	O
to	O
walk.	O
It	O
is	O
rare	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
pain	O
free	O
day	O
anymore.	O
I'm	O
miserable	O
and	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
quite	O
healthy	O
and	O
active.	O
It	O
should	O
be	O
taken	O
off	O
market.	O
We	O
should	O
be	O
compensated.	O
It's	O
changed	O
my	O
life	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
of	O
the	O
loss	O
every	O
single	O
day.	O
I	O
get	O
4	O
pain	O
free	O
days	O
per	O
year.	O

For	O
the	O
first	O
8	O
days	O
of	O
ever	O
taking	O
it,	O
the	O
only	O
side	O
effect	O
was	O
a	O
similar	O
feeling	O
you	O
get	O
when	O
you	O
have	O
an	O
empty	O
stomach	O
and	O
light	O
nausea	O
that	O
lasted	O
for	O
no	O
more	O
that	O
30	O
minutes	O
After	O
8	O
days,	O
the	O
feeling	O
elevated	O
to	O
an	O
annoying	O
sharp	O
pain	O
in	O
my	O
stomach.	O
Then	O
two	O
days	O
later,	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
stop	O
using	O
it	O
because	O
the	O
pain	O
was	O
becoming	O
unbearable.	O
Now	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
off	O
for	O
two	O
days	O
and	O
I	O
still	O
have	O
the	O
stomach	O
pain.	O
Aside	O
from	O
the	O
stomach	O
pain,	O
it	O
worked	O
miracle	O
on	O
my	O
nighttime	O
spinal	O
pain.	O
Now	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
see	O
my	O
doctor	O
again	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
I	O
should	O
keep	O
taking	O
it.	O
I	O
tried	O
Naprosyn	O
just	O
before	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
reasons.	O

Within	O
a	O
week	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
taking	O
the	O
prescribe	O
dose,	O
I	O
began	O
developing	O
something	O
I	O
never	O
had	O
before:	O
eczema.	O
It	O
became	O
progressively	O
worse,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
month	O
had	O
created	O
a	O
massive	O
triangular	O
rash	O
on	O
my	O
forehead,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
a	O
patch	O
on	O
one	O
cheek.	O
The	O
skin	O
was	O
very	O
red	O
and	O
rough,	O
and	O
made	O
public	O
life	O
miserable	O
and	O
embarassing.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor	O
and	O
the	O
rash	O
cleared	O
up	O
greatly,	O
but	O
has	O
NEVER	O
gone	O
away	O
completly,	O
flaring	O
up	O
slightly	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time,	O
but	O
not	O
nearly	O
as	O
bad	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
during	O
dosing	O
with	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
taking	O
any	O
other	O
medications	O
at	O
the	O
time,	O
and	O
never	O
had	O
eczema	O
before.	O
The	O
anti-lipid	O
effect	O
of	O
Lipitor	O
was	O
unusually	O
strong	O
in	O
my	O
case,	O
causing	O
my	O
CHO	O
to	O
drop	O
below	O
90	O
(from	O
a	O
baseline	O
of	O
over	O
200).	O
by	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
2	O
weeks	O
of	O
dosing,	O
my	O
physician	O
had	O
me	O
cutting	O
the	O
smallest	O
dose	O
tablet	O
in	O
half	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
once	O
a	O
day.	O
Even	O
so,	O
the	O
rash	O
continued	O
to	O
enlarge	O
and	O
get	O
worse,	O
so	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O

for	O
a	O

of	O

I	O
found	O
this	O

legs	O
feel	O
leaden,	O
initially,	O
lower	O
back	O
pain	O
(but	O
I've	O
had	O
that	O
before),	O
cramps	O
in	O

More	O
problems	O
with	O
my	O
sinuses.	O
Woke	O
up	O
with	O
severe	O
vertigo,	O
but	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
due	O
to	O
a	O
cold	O
virus.	O
However,	O
I've	O
never	O
had	O
it	O
before	O
with	O
a	O
cold.	O
Severe	O
gas,	O
and	O
intestinal	O
distention.	O
Constipation.	O
I	O
take	O
other	O
medications.	O
Some	O
for	O
high	O
blood	O
pressure,	O
and	O
thyroid	O
medication.	O
However,	O
I	O
didn't	O
have	O
side	O
effects	O
from	O
any	O
of	O
those	O
medications.	O
When	O
I	O
started	O
Lipitor,	O
Immediately	O
had	O
lower	O
back	O
pain,	O
then	O
pain	O
in	O
my	O
thighs	O
(muscle	O
cramping).	O
It	O
doesn't	O
seem	O
to	O
matter	O
what	O
foods	O
I	O
eat,	O
I	O
always	O
get	O
distention	O
and	O
gas	O
while	O
on	O
this	O
drug.	O
This	O
is	O
an	O
unpleasant	O
(for	O
everyone	O
near	O
me)	O
side	O
effect.	O
Since	O
my	O
Dr	O
is	O
out	O
of	O
town,	O
and	O
I've	O
only	O
been	O
on	O
the	O
medication	O
for	O
6	O
weeks	O
(10mg),	O
I'm	O
stopping	O
it	O
until	O
I	O
get	O
in	O
to	O
see	O
her.	O
I've	O
also	O
had	O
very	O
different	O
cholesterol	O
readings	O
over	O
the	O
years,	O
and	O
am	O
skeptical	O
that	O
any	O
given	O
time	O
you	O
go	O
in	O
for	O
a	O
blood	O
test,	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
very	O
different.	O
It's	O
just	O
that	O
my	O
last	O
one	O
was	O
high	O
(275!)	O
But	O
sometimes	O
it's	O
170.	O
And	O
it's	O
also	O
been	O
borderline	O
for	O
many	O
years,	O
around	O
200.	O
(with	O
the	O
good	O
cholesterol	O
very	O
good).	O
I	O
think	O
it's	O
higher	O
these	O
days,	O
because	O
I've	O
been	O
in	O
menopause	O
longer.	O
But	O
I	O
wonder	O
if	O
side	O
effects	O
to	O
any	O
drug	O
aren't	O
a	O
message	O
that.	O

At	O
the	O
beginning	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
had	O
any	O
side	O
effects,	O
until	O
a	O
few	O
months	O
after	O
start	O
taking	O
Lipitor	O
I	O
experienced	O
pain	O
in	O
the	O
lower	O
legs,	O
sometimes	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
even	O
walk	O
in	O
the	O
mornings	O
my	O
muscles	O
were	O
very	O
stiff.	O
After	O
consulting	O
with	O
my	O
doctor	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
Lipitor	O
until	O
the	O
pain	O
went	O
away	O
and	O
to	O
start	O
taking	O
it	O
after	O
the	O
pain	O
was	O
gone.	O
I	O
followed	O
the	O
doctor's	O
order.	O
After	O
a	O
few	O
more	O
months	O
of	O
taking	O
Lipitor	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
develop	O
severe	O
pain	O
in	O
the	O
muscles	O
in	O
the	O
shoulder	O
area,	O
upper	O
back	O
and	O
neck,	O
the	O
pain	O
and	O
stiffness	O
of	O
my	O
neck	O
was	O
so	O
bad	O
that	O
sometimes	O
I	O
couldn't	O
even	O
turn	O
my	O
head	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
driving.	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
my	O
doctor	O
and	O
she	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
stress.	O
I	O
took	O
off	O
work	O
for	O
a	O
month	O
and	O
during	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
tried	O
to	O
relax	O
and	O
the	O
pain	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
away.	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
be	O
off	O
Lipitor	O
on	O
my	O
own	O
and	O
within	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
weeks,	O
the	O
pain	O
and	O
stiffness	O
from	O
the	O
neck	O
and	O
pain	O
in	O
the	O
shoulder	O
and	O
back	O
is	O
going	O
away,	O
I	O
feel	O
much	O
better	O
now	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
taking	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
think	O
I	O
will	O
take	O
Lipitor	O
ever	O
again,	O
the	O
problems	O
that	O
have	O
been	O
causing	O
me	O
are	O
too	O
much	O
to	O
risk	O
my	O
health	O
again.	O
I	O
will	O
look	O
for	O
alternatives	O
ways	O
of	O
reducing	O
my	O
collesterol.	O

I	O
only	O
took	O
20	O
mg	O
daily	O
for	O
2	O
weeks	O
-	O
several	O
days	O
after	O
stopping	O
my	O
toes	O
went	O
into	O
muscle	O
spasms.	O
Don't	O
know	O
it	O
there	O
was	O
any	O
connection.	O
After	O
only	O
2	O
weeks	O
on	O
Lipitor,	O
my	O
total	O
cholesterol	O
fell	O
from	O
306	O
to	O
178;	O
LDL	O
fell	O
from	O
178	O
to	O
70;	O
and,	O
my	O
HDL	O
went	O
from	O
116	O
to	O
89	O
(didn't	O
like	O
this	O
result,	O
but	O
did	O
like	O
the	O
change	O
in	O
the	O
LDL).	O
Overall	O
the	O
results	O
were	O
significant.	O
I	O
will	O
start	O
taking	O
it	O
again	O
as	O
my	O
cardiologist	O
has	O
encouraged	O
me	O
to	O
stay	O
on	O
the	O
medication.	O
After	O
reading	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
comments	O
in	O
this	O
website,	O
I	O
will	O
remain	O
cautious	O
and	O
look	O

I	O
was	O
on	O
Voltaren	O
to	O
work	O
as	O
an	O
anti-inflammatory	O
for	O
my	O
infection.	O
The	O
drug	O
was	O

On	O

of	O
my	O

I	O
experience	O
an	O
excruciating	O

in	O
my	O

but	O
much	O
worse.	O
Along	O
with	O
that	O
I	O
also	O
had	O
a	O
sharp	O
pain	O
on	O
my	O
shoulder	O
and	O
couldnt	O
sit	O
straight.	O
I	O
was	O

after	O
20	O
min	O
of	O
the	O

I	O
am	O

The	O

the	O

I	O

and	O
doing	O
much	O
better	O
after	O

I	O
would	O

Over	O
the	O
past	O
three	O
years	O
the	O
drug	O
has	O
definately	O
worked	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
developed	O
almost	O
a	O
dibilitating	O
problem	O
with	O
both	O
of	O
my	O
arms.	O
I	O
am	O
unable	O
to	O
move	O
them	O
in	O
any	O
direction	O
but	O
the	O
normal	O
motion.	O
It	O
has	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
turning	O
over	O
in	O
bed	O
wakes	O
me	O
up	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
pain	O
it	O
causes.	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
a	O
blood	O
test	O
to	O
determine	O
if	O
Lipior	O
is	O
causing	O
this	O
serious	O
problem	O
and	O
the	O
results	O
said	O
no	O
it	O
wasn't.	O
However,	O
I	O
even	O
went	O
to	O
an	O
orthopdetic	O
surgeon	O
and	O
after	O
he	O
checked	O
me	O
out,	O
he	O
looked	O
at	O
the	O
drugs	O
that	O
I	O
take	O
(i	O
am	O
also	O
a	O
type	O
2	O
diabetic)	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
ahh,	O
Lipitor.	O
more	O
people	O
taking	O
this	O
drug	O
come	O
to	O
me	O
with	O
problems	O
like	O
this	O
.	O
I	O
have	O
an	O
annual	O
physical	O
on	O
8/27	O
and	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
tell	O
the	O
doctor	O
I'm	O
stopping	O
the	O
Lipitor	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
happens.	O

Severe	O
pain	O
in	O
both	O
calfs	O
and	O
thighs.	O
I	O
became	O
unable	O
to	O
lift	O
my	O
legs	O
to	O
put	O
on	O
my	O
pants	O
or	O
even	O
get	O
in	O
the	O
car.	O
This	O
developed	O
after	O
being	O
on	O
the	O
Lipitor	O
for	O
about	O
5	O
years.	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
10	O
mg	O
and	O
complained	O
about	O
discomfort	O
in	O
my	O
legs	O
but	O
my	O
cardiologist	O
just	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
old	O
age	O
and	O
even	O
upped	O
my	O
dose	O
to	O
20	O
mg.	O
That	O
really	O
made	O
things	O
a	O
lot	O
worst	O
and	O
now	O
I	O
just	O
stopped	O
it	O
and	O
within	O
24	O
hours	O
could	O
see	O
an	O
improvement.	O
Incidently	O
I	O
am	O
a	O
physician	O
and	O
was	O
aware	O
of	O
the	O
myalgia	O
with	O
Lipitor	O
but	O
I	O
suspect	O
it	O
is	O
much	O
worst	O
than	O
the	O
drug	O
company	O
would	O
have	O
you	O
believe.	O
This	O
is	O
really	O
a	O
very	O
toxic	O
drug	O
and	O
should	O
be	O
used	O
with	O
caution.	O
This	O
is	O
a	O
drug	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
effective	O
in	O
lowering	O
cholesterol	O
but	O
also	O
affects	O
many	O
metabolic	O
pathways	O
in	O
the	O
body	O
and	O
is	O
potentially	O
dangerous.	O

Indigestion,	O
intense	O
heart	O
pain,	O
sore	O
muscles,	O
anxious,	O
restless,	O
lack	O
of	O
sleep.	O
Has	O
anyone	O
had	O
severe	O
chest	O
pain?	O
I	O
have	O
loss	O
the	O
will	O
to	O
do	O
anything.	O
no	O
sleep,	O
emotional,	O
just	O
plain	O
want	O
to	O
give	O
up.	O

The	O
same	O
as	O
many	O
people	O
reported	O
muscle	O
aches	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
tingling	O
in	O
arm	O
and	O
hand,	O
sore	O
shoulder,fatigue,poor	O
sleep	O
although	O
it	O
did	O
lower	O
my	O
cholesterol,	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
warned	O
of	O
the	O
symtoms.	O
Surprisingly	O
when	O
I	O
told	O
my	O
doctor	O
I	O
was	O
having	O
these	O
problems	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
suggest	O
stopping	O
the	O
lipitor	O
nor	O
did	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
specialists	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
see	O
for	O
these	O
symptoms,	O
a	O
friend	O
told	O
me	O
about	O
the	O
side	O
affects	O
after	O
I	O
told	O
her	O
my	O
symptoms,	O
she	O
said	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
statins	O
and	O
what	O
was	O
I	O
taking?	O
Lipitor!	O
I	O
have	O
since	O
changed	O
doctors	O
because	O
my	O
doctor	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
believe	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
lipitor	O
since	O
it	O
should	O
have	O
affected	O
me	O
on	O
both	O
arms	O
and	O
hands,	O
but	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
stopped	O
the	O
lipitor	O
I	O
stated	O
to	O
feel	O
better,	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
three	O
weeks	O
now	O
I	O
still	O
have	O
some	O
pain	O
in	O
muscles,	O
but	O
severe	O
fatigue	O
is	O
gone,	O
Problem	O
now	O
is	O
my	O
new	O
doctor	O
is	O
suggesting	O
Pravachol!	O
I	O
would	O
rather	O
live	O
a	O
shorter	O
life	O
than	O
suffer	O
the	O
pains	O
and	O
fatigue	O
for	O
many	O
years.	O

My	O
doctor	O
switched	O
me	O
from	O
Pravachol	O
to	O
Lipitor	O
almost	O
a	O
year	O
ago	O
because	O
of	O
a	O
study	O
that	O
was	O
done	O
in	O
CHF	O
patients	O
and	O
when	O
Lipitor	O
was	O
used,	O
hospitalizations	O
were	O
cut	O
almost	O
in	O
half.	O
Normally	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
hospital	O
a	O
minimum	O
of	O
2	O
times	O
a	O
year.	O
Since	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
Lipitor,	O
I	O
have	O
not	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
hospital	O
even	O
once!	O
Also,	O
he	O
also	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
Lipitor	O
was	O
better	O
for	O
my	O
kidneys	O
than	O
the	O
statins.	O

taken	O
since	O
2004,	O
just	O
got	O
off	O
this	O
stuff	O
a	O
month	O
or	O
so	O
now,	O
had	O
memory	O
loss,	O
extreme	O
ache	O
in	O
left	O
arm	O
and	O
sometimes	O
left	O
leg.	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
another	O
issue,	O
spent	O
the	O
last	O
4	O
years	O
with	O
neurologists	O
doing	O
MRI,	O
nerve	O
tests,	O
every	O
test	O
known	O
to	O
detect	O
the	O
reason	O
for	O
this.	O
nothing	O
found.	O
decided	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
lipitor	O
and	O
am	O
much	O
improved.	O
can	O
do	O
many	O
things	O
without	O
my	O
arm	O
aching	O
now.	O
this	O
ache	O
was	O
extreme,	O
almost	O
unbearable,	O
many	O
doctors	O
just	O
ignore	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
of	O
this	O
drug.	O

Lower	O
back	O
pain,	O
stiffness	O
in	O
joints.	O

After	O
taking	O
the	O
drug	O
for	O
7	O
years,	O
i've	O
suddenly	O
developped	O
diarrhea,	O
nausea,	O
loss	O
of	O
apetite,	O
stomach	O
cramps.	O
I've	O
had	O
these	O
symptoms	O
for	O
4	O
weeks	O
and	O
i've	O
just	O
realised	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
side	O
effects	O
from	O
arthotec.	O
The	O
problem	O
is	O
if	O
i	O
stop	O
arthrotec	O
I	O
become	O
paralysed	O
by	O
back	O
pain.	O
Seeing	O
the	O
doctor	O
next	O
week.	O
But	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
my	O
symptoms	O
are	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
drug	O
as	O
i've	O
been	O
on	O
it	O
for	O
so	O
long	O
with	O
no	O
side	O
effects.	O
After	O
trying	O
several	O
NSAIDs	O
with	O
side	O
effects,	O
I	O
finally	O
discovered	O
arthrotec	O
which	O
relieved	O
the	O
pain	O
and	O
no	O
side	O
effects.	O
I	O
usually	O
take	O
1	O
or	O
2	O
a	O
day	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
pain	O
gets	O
really	O
bad	O
increase	O
it	O
to	O
3	O
a	O
day	O
for	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
weeks.	O

Extremely	O
heavy	O
menstral	O
cycles,	O
fatigue,	O
slow	O
healing	O
&	O
clotting.	O
If	O
I	O
miss	O
a	O
day,	O
headaches	O
begin	O
to	O
creep	O
in.	O
Tried	O
many	O
others,	O
this	O
seemed	O
to	O
work	O
best	O
for	O
quite	O
some	O
time.	O
No	O
day	O
is	O
pain	O

though.	O
Not	O
bad	O
on	O

-	O
always	O
take	O
w/	O
milk	O
or	O
food.	O
This	O
is	O
genetic	O
for	O
me,	O
so	O
NSAIDs	O
will	O
be	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
for	O
a	O
while.	O
but	O
fear	O
long-term	O

this	O
one.	O

Beware	O
of	O
this	O

Didn't	O
work.	O

This	O
greatly	O
improved	O
the	O

when	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
surgery	O
on	O
both	O
legs.	O
There	O
weren't	O
any	O

maybe	O
a	O
little	O

but	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
related	O
to	O
the	O

I	O
would	O
recommend	O
this	O
to	O
anyone	O
that	O
has	O
swelling	O
of	O
any	O
sort	O
to	O
help	O
heal	O
an	O
injury.	O
The	O
doctor	O
did	O
say	O
to	O
only	O
take	O
it	O
5	O
days	O
though	O
because	O
it	O
reduces	O
mucus	O
in	O
the	O
stomach	O
and	O
it	O
can	O
cause	O
extreme	O
stomach	O
pain	O
if	O
taken	O
too	O
long.	O

During	O
the	O
next	O
3	O

the	O
wheezing	O
became	O
a	O
24/7	O
side	O
effect,	O
with	O
it	O
being	O
so	O
bad	O
at	O
night,	O
I	O
couldn't	O
sleep	O
for	O
more	O
than	O
45	O

The	O
wheezing	O
literally	O
woke	O
me	O
up,	O
it	O
was	O

I	O
also	O

I	O
look	O

about	O
1	O
1/2	O

when	O
I	O
no	O

a	O
decreased	O

(not	O

At	O
the	O
time	O
I	O
attributed	O
it	O
to	O
male	O
menopause-being	O
around	O
54.	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
my	O
accupuncturist	O
and	O
was	O
told	O
my	O
chee	O
was	O
dry.	O
Had	O
4	O
treatments	O
over	O
as	O
many	O
weeks.	O
Started	O
to	O

some	O
improvement.	O
At	O
the	O

I	O

very	O

Went	O

for	O
2	O

Doctor	O
took	O

off.	O
Said	O
it	O
was	O

my	O

Had	O
only	O
taken	O
my	O

down	O
30	O

I	O
started	O

I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
related	O
to	O
the	O
lipitor,	O
but	O
shortly	O
after	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
it,	O
I	O
exprienced	O
complete	O
paralysis	O
in	O
my	O
forehead	O
(peripheral	O

Went	O
to	O
a	O
neurologist,GP	O
and	O
ENT,	O
none	O
of	O
whom	O
have	O
ever	O
seen	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
paralysis	O
(both	O
sides)	O
with	O
no	O
other	O
symptoms.	O
Has	O
any	O
one	O
else	O
come	O
across	O
this	O
symptom?	O
I	O
m	O
tempted	O
to	O
go	O
off	O
the	O
medicine	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
the	O
paralysis	O
goes	O
away.	O
It	O
really	O
lowered	O
my	O
cholestrol	O
a	O
lot,	O
so	O
I	O
hope	O
this	O

isn;t	O
related.	O

40	O
years	O
old	O
and	O
should	O
not	O
feel	O
like	O
this.	O
Out	O
of	O
nowhere,	O
I	O
heard	O
about	O
CoQ10	O
depletion	O
and	O
just	O
started	O
the	O
supplement	O
today.	O
I	O
was	O
never	O
told	O
ANY	O
of	O
these	O
symptoms	O
could	O
relate	O
to	O
the	O
Lipitor	O
-	O
in	O
fact,	O
I	O
specifically	O
asked	O
if	O
any	O
of	O
my	O
medications	O
could	O
be	O
causing	O
these	O
problems.	O

For	O
the	O
first	O

I	O
took	O
one	O
pill	O
at	O
bedtime,	O
but	O
then	O
switched	O
to	O
mornings	O
with	O
breakfast.	O
I	O
experienced	O
extreme	O
uterine	O
cramping	O
within	O
30	O
minutes	O
of	O
taking	O
in	O
the	O
morning;	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
excruciating	O
pain	O
for	O
an	O
hour	O
so	O
I	O
called	O
an	O
ambulance	O
and	O
was	O
rushed	O
to	O
the	O
emergency	O
room.	O
Heavy	O
bleeding	O
started	O
within	O
30	O
minutes	O
after	O
the	O
cramping	O
ceased.	O
Medical	O
personnel	O
dismissed	O
the	O
symptoms	O
as	O
not	O
being	O
related	O
to	O
taking	O
this	O
drug,	O
but	O
once	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking,	O
my	O
cramping	O
and	O
bleeding	O
stopped.	O
Subsequent	O
uterine	O
&	O
vaginal	O

did	O
not	O
show	O
anything	O
else	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
cause.	O
My	O
OB/Gyn	O
told	O

(1	O

advised	O

i'll	O
have	O
to	O
take	O
lipitor	O
for	O
the	O

of	O

That	O

I	O

my	O

after	O

I	O
am	O
typically	O
an	O
easy	O

positively	O

stable,	O
and	O

person.	O
But	O
after	O
starting	O
Lipitor	O
I've	O
gradually	O
descended	O
into	O
a	O
world	O
of	O
extreme	O
anxiety,	O
hopelessness,	O
lonliness,	O
and	O
self	O
loathing.	O
I've	O
never	O
in	O

about	O

After	O

off	O

for	O

48	O
hours,	O
I	O
am	O
already	O
beginning	O
to	O
see	O
an	O
improvement	O
in	O
my	O
moods,	O
but	O
this	O
will	O
be	O
a	O
long	O
journey	O
back	O
to	O
my	O
old	O
self,	O
I	O
feel.	O
Oh	O
yes,	O
and	O
I	O
also	O
suffered	O
from:	O
Gas,	O
Constipation,	O
EXTREME	O
FATIGUE,	O
weight	O
gain	O
and	O
bloating,	O
and	O
occassional	O
bouts	O
of	O
diaharrea.	O
It	O
lowered	O
my	O
cholesterol,	O
to	O
be	O
sure.	O
But	O
it	O
also	O
significantly	O
lowered	O
my	O
quality	O
of	O
life.	O
This	O
website	O
has	O
been	O
an	O
absolute	O
lifeline	O
for	O
me.	O
My	O
doctor	O
had	O
seemed	O
so	O
completely	O
unwilling	O
to	O
accept	O
that	O
my	O
symptoms	O
could've	O
possibly	O
been	O
related	O
to	O
my	O
taking	O
Lipitor.	O
However,	O
I	O
know	O
my	O
body	O
and	O
know	O
when	O
things	O
are	O
not	O
as	O
they	O
should	O
be.	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
feeling	O
this	O
way	O
since	O
almost	O
immediately	O
after	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
first	O
dose.	O
Hearing	O
that	O
so	O
many	O
other	O
people	O
have	O
experienced	O
the	O
same	O
exact	O
symptoms	O
as	O
me	O
has	O
given	O
me	O
the	O
courage	O
needed	O
to	O
STOP	O
this	O
medication.	O
So	O
many	O
of	O
my	O
family	O
members	O
and	O
friends	O
have	O
had	O
bad	O
reactions	O
to	O
this	O
stuff-	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
trust	O
it,	O
and	O
will	O
be	O
looking	O
for	O
another	O
way	O
to	O
get	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
under	O
control,	O
if	O
possible.	O
Be	O
very	O
careful	O
and	O
very	O
informed	O
before	O
you	O
start	O
any	O
new	O
medication.	O
Don't	O
always	O
trust	O
the	O
word	O
of	O
your	O
doctor	O
as	O
the	O
only	O
word	O
and	O
take	O
it	O
at	O
its	O
face	O
value.	O
When	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
your	O
body,	O
you	O
have	O
every	O
right	O
to	O
dictate,	O
understand,	O
and	O
call	O
the	O
shots	O
about	O
what	O
does	O
and	O
does	O
not	O
go	O
in	O
to	O
it.	O

I	O
had	O
muscle	O
cramps	O
and	O
muscle	O
pain.	O
I	O
had	O
muscle	O
pain	O
in	O
my	O
chest.	O
After	O
I	O
quit	O
taking	O
Lipitor	O
for	O
3	O
days	O
the	O
pain	O
was	O
almost	O
gone.	O

None	O
for	O
three	O
years,	O
then	O
bam!	O
Toes	O
became	O
so	O
painful	O
I	O
couldn't	O
stand	O
it,	O
as	O
did	O

Lipitor	O
made	O
my	O

numbers	O
improve	O
greatly	O
for	O
three	O
years.	O
But	O
alas,	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
finally	O
showed	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
vengeance,	O
and	O
I	O
can	O
no	O

take	O
Lipitor.	O

Stomach	O

When	O

When	O

Doc	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
10	O
mg/day.	O
Some	O
stomach	O
discomfort	O
initially,	O
but	O
I	O
seemed	O
to	O
get	O
over	O
that	O
after	O
the	O
first	O
few	O
weeks.	O
Some	O
muscle	O

I	O

a	O

And	O
just	O
yesterday,	O
was	O

clean-up,	O
and	O
noticed	O
extreme	O

Very	O
worrisome.	O
I	O
have	O
stopped	O
taking	O

will	O
check	O
back	O
with	O
my	O

I	O
just	O
recently	O
had	O
my	O
3	O
month	O

check-up,	O
and	O
the	O

was	O
very	O

since	O
my	O

dropped	O
to	O
3.7	O
from	O
over	O

I	O

I	O
took	O
Lipitor	O
for	O
about	O
a	O

I	O
had	O

almost	O

order	O
to	O
stand	O
up	O
without	O
pain.	O
I	O
told	O
my	O
doctor	O
I	O
took	O
myself	O
off	O
the	O
drug.	O
I	O
know	O
my	O
own	O
body	O
after	O
65	O
yrs	O
and	O
I	O
NEVER	O
had	O
muscle	O
pain	O
before.	O
What	O
else	O
could	O
I	O
attribute	O
this	O
pain	O
to?	O
Why	O
is	O
there	O
such	O
denial	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
damage	O
this	O
drug	O
can	O
do.	O
I	O
admit	O
cholesterol	O
went	O
down	O
but	O
so	O
did	O
my	O
muscles	O
and	O
stamina.	O
I	O
feel	O
somewhat	O
better	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
two	O
months	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
off	O
the	O
drug.	O
Do	O
Research	O
before	O
taking.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
taken	O
for	O
approximately	O
4	O
yrs.	O
I	O
have	O
some	O
difficulty	O
with	O
digestive	O
system	O
and	O
some	O
muscle	O
pain	O
and	O
joint	O
pain.	O
Lipitor	O
did	O
the	O
job	O
on	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
both	O
LDL	O
and	O
HDL.	O
I	O
have	O
quit	O
taken	O
recently	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
it	O
affects	O
above	O
problems.	O
It	O
probably	O
is	O
a	O
trade	O
off.	O
I	O
feel	O
that	O
the	O
drug	O
is	O
too	O
expensive.	O
I	O
do	O
think	O
that	O
it	O
will	O
do	O
what	O
it	O
is	O
used	O
for,	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
your	O
body	O
pays	O
a	O
price.	O
Again	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
trade	O
off.	O

Most	O
of	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
everyone	O
else	O
has:	O
weak	O
legs,	O
muscle	O
and	O
back	O
soreness,	O
ears	O
ringing,	O
feel	O
bad,	O
all	O
usually	O
in	O
the	O
mornings.	O
However,	O
it	O
lowered	O
my	O
cholesterol,	O
tryglycerides,	O
and	O
blood	O
pressure,	O
along	O
with	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
exercising.	O
I	O
had	O
by-pass	O
surgery	O
in	O
1986,	O
angioplasty	O
in	O
the	O
mid	O
90's,	O
started	O
on	O
Zocor,	O
then	O
my	O
doctor	O
switched	O
me	O
to	O
Lipitor	O
and	O
have	O
not	O
had	O
to	O
have	O
either	O
since	O
I	O
started	O
on	O
the	O
statins.	O
(started	O
with	O
20mg.	O
then	O
40mg.,	O
and	O
now	O
80mg.)	O
Its	O
not	O
perfect,	O
but	O
it	O
keeps	O
me	O
alive.	O
I	O
am	O
now	O
65	O
and	O
I	O
thank	O
God	O
every	O
single	O
day	O
for	O
my	O
doctor	O
and	O
my	O
medicine.	O
I	O
just	O

is	O

thought	O
that	O
I	O

out	O

it	O
might	O
