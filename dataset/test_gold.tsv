10	O

Lipitor	B-DRU
for	O
about	O
3	O

I	O

problems	O
which	O
got	O
worse	O
while	O
I	O
continued	O
to	O

it	O
as	O

by	O

After	O
6	O

my	O
speech	B-ADR
and	O

were	O
so	O
bad	O
that	O
I	O
stopped	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O
It	O
is	O
now	O
one	O
year	O
after	O

and	O
I	O
was	O
diagnosed	O
with	O

(which	O

and	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
beginning	O
to	O
improve	O
in	O
speech	O

but	O
very	O

and	O
I	O
may	O
never	O
get	O
back	O
to	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
before	O
Lipitor.	O
It	O
has	O
also	O
affected	B-ADR
my	I-ADR
memory.	O
Had	O
Pfizer	O
just	O
mentioned	O
in	O
their	O
precautions	O
that	O
Lipitor	B-DRU
just	O
might	O
cause	O
speech	B-ADR
and	O
swallowing	B-ADR
problems,	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
stopped	O
taking	O
statin	O
drugs	O
6	O
months	O
earlier	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
OK	O
again.	O

This	O
medicine	O
completely	O
relieves	O
my	O
thumb	B-SYM
pain,	O
and	O
really	O
helps	O
with	O
my	O
back	B-SYM
pain.	O
BUT,	O
it	O
makes	O
my	O
stomach	B-ADR
hurt	I-ADR
soooo	I-ADR
bad	I-ADR
that	O
I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
what	O
is	O
worse.	O
I	O
only	O
use	O
it	O
when	O
my	O
thumbs	B-SYM
hurt	I-SYM
so	I-SYM
bad	I-SYM
I	O
want	O
to	O
cry.	O
Then	O
I	O
put	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain.	O
It	O
also	O
give	O
you	O
diarrhea	B-ADR
but	O
I	O
can	O
handle	O
that.	O

This	O
drug	O
MAY	O
have	O
caused	O
edema	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
fingers	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
face	I-ADR
after	O
taking	O
for	O
4	O
days.	O
Also	O
may	O
have	O
caused	O
shortness	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
breath.	O
Also	O
some	O
crabbiness	B-ADR
and	O
cramping	B-ADR
(as	O
in	O

Timing	B-ADR
off	I-ADR
for	I-ADR
a	I-ADR
true	I-ADR

so	O
suspect	O
Voltaren	B-DRU
is	O
the	O
culprit.	O
Took	O
one	O
50	O
mg	O
pill	O
each	O
day	O
for	O
5	O
days.	O
The	O
first	O
day	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
make	O
all	O
the	O
pain	O
of	O
a	O
muscle	B-SYM
spasm	I-SYM
in	O
shoulder	O
go	O
away.	O
It	O
almost	O
seemed	O
like	O
a	O
miracle.	O
The	O
effects	O
diminished	O
each	O
day	O
(I	O
have	O
pain	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O
time)	O
and	O
now	O
my	O

and	O
I	O
am	O

Interesting	O
to	O

I	O
will	O
NEVER	O
take	O
another	O
one	O

these.	O

I've	O
been	O
taking	O
LIPITOR	B-DRU
for	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
(had	O
been	O
on	O
Baycol),.	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
years	O
ago,	O
I	O
began	O
experiencing	O
increasing	O
joint	B-ADR
and	O
muscle	B-ADR
pain	O
that	O
is	O
now	O
so	O
severe	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
wodering	O
if	O
it's	O
worth	O
living	O
with	O
such	O
pain.	O
I'm	O
very	O
depressed.	O
The	O
pain	B-ADR
is	O
often	O
so	O
severe	O
that	O
it	O
limits	B-ADR
my	I-ADR
ability	I-ADR
to	O
walk	O
and	O
climb	O
stairs,	O
to	O
lift	O
anything	O
heavier	O
than	O
a	O

I've	O
had	O
some	O
excruciating	O
thigh	B-ADR
cramps,	O
and	O
more	O
recently,	O
I	O
have	O
noticed	O
a	O
generalized	O
weakness	B-ADR
all	O
over	O
my	O
body.	O
It	O
scares	O
me	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
some	O
statin	O
drug	O
because	O
my	O
cholesterol	B-DIS
was	I-DIS
very	I-DIS
high	I-DIS
without	O
them,	O
but	O
my	O
quality	O
of	O
life	O
is	O
so	O
drastically	O
affected	O
that	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
have	O
to.	O
I	O
believe	O
it's	O
very	O
dangerous	O
stuff.	O

and	O
now	O
am	O
pretty	O
convinced	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-DRU
from	O
all	O
I	O
have	O
read	O
on	O
this	O

Was	O

Will	O

and	O
try	O
to	O
resume	O

-once	O
my	O
muscle	B-ADR

heals	O
and	O
hopefully	O
it	O
won't	O
recur.	O

I	O
have	O
nothing	O
yet	O
just	O
took	O
it	O
my	O
first	O
time,	O
but	O
I	O
am	O

I	O

anyone	O

onthe	O

just	O

this	O

Anxiety,	O
paranoia.	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
see	O
my	O
doctor	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
about	O
my	O
discovery.	O
First	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
reluctant	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
following	O
meeting	O
he	O
already	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
read	O
about	O
Lipitor's	B-DRU
psychiatric	O
side	O
effects.	O
He	O
therefore	O
put	O
me	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-DRU
completely	O
and	O
suggested	O
a	O
much	O
lower	O
dosage	O
of	O
10mg	O
Crestor.	O
In	O
addition,	O
he	O
prescribed	O
a	O
new	O
medication:	O
Niacin,	O
beginning	O
with	O
500mg	O
the	O
first	O
month	O
and	O
then	O
increasing	O
to	O
1,000	O
in	O
the	O
second	O
(with	O
the	O
ultimate	O
aim	O
of	O
reaching	O
2,000	O
in	O
the	O
fourth	O
monthly).	O
Bottom	O
line:	O
When	O
I	O
discontinued	O
Lipitor	B-DRU
two	O
months	O
ago	O
my	O
LDL	O
reached	O
165.	O
This	O
week	O
my	O
blood	O
test	O
indicated	O
an	O
LDL	O
level	O
of	O
124.	O
So,	O
after	O
being	O
helped	O
by	O
folks	O
on	O
this	O
website	O
I	O
hope	O
I	O
can	O
be	O
of	O
some	O
help	O
to	O
others	O
who	O
suffer	O
from	O
statin	O
side	O
effects.	O
Therefore,	O
here	O
is	O
what	O
I've	O
done	O
during	O
the	O
past	O
two	O
months:	O
-	O
Took	O
500mg	O
of	O

First	O
the	O

I	O
had	O
gastritis	O
from	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
abdomen,	O

flushing	B-ADR
-	O
I	O

an	O

then	O

(2)	O
and	O
then	O
yesterday	O
an	O

all	O
were	O

The	O

continue.	O
I	O
am	O
taking	O
myself	O
off	O
this	O

and	O
hope	O
that	O
my	O
apparently	O
healthy	O
body	O
recovers.	O
Why	O
is	O
my	O
doctor	O
unaware	O
of	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-DRU
side	O
effects?	O
Why	O
did	O
I	O
spend	O
almost	O
$1,000	O
of	O
my	O

AFTER	O

on	O
all	O
these	O

without	O

that	O
my	O

match	O
those	O
for	O

So	O
frustrating!	O
I	O
will	O
check	O

how	O
I	O

since	O

I've	O
developed	O
horrible	B-ADR

in	I-ADR
both	O

Sleeping	O

to	O
think	O
its	O
normal	O

(I'm	O
only	O
55)	O
and	O
internist	O
is	O
skeptical	O
that	O
lipitor	B-DRU
is	O
the	O
culprit.	O
I	O
have	O
also	O
noticed	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
short	B-ADR

the	O

today	O

the	O

I	O

two	O

and	O
my	O
back	B-ADR

is	O
beginning	O
to	O

away.	O
I	O
would	O

even	O
though	O
it	O
did	O
work	O
to	O

After	O
a	O

Lipitor	B-DRU

I	O
think	O
these	O

really	O
screwed	O
me	O
up.	O
Don't	O
use	O
statin	O
drugs.	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
dangerous!!.	O

muscle	B-ADR

after	O

I	O

the	O

I	O

well	O
with	O
Lipitor	B-DRU
for	O
the	O

2	O
1/2	O

It	O
has	O
reduced	O
my	O

significantly-from	O
over	O
300	O
to	O

150.	O
Two	O
weeks	O
ago	O
I	O
was	O
given	O
the	O

This	O
week	O
I	O

that	O
all	O

were	I-ADR
tingling,	O
a	O
pins	B-ADR

It	O
was	O
like	O
they	O

asleep.	O
I	O
immediately	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
pharmacy	O
and	O
got	O

(luckily	O
my	O

pays-it	O
will	O
be	O
$15/	O
3	O

more,	O
but	O
it's	O

it).	O
I	O
have	O

just	O
within	O
the	O
last	O
two	O

the	O

Thank	O
goodness!	O
I	O
read	O
that	O

have	O
the	O

there	O
may	O
be	O
a	O

in	O
how	O
the	O

It's	O

I	O
was	O

I	O

3	O

I	O

I	O
was	O

that	O
it	O

a	O

They	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
probably	O

to	O

or	O
a	O

--	O
ridiculous	O
because	O
I	O

and	O
have	O
never	O

I'm	O

Now	O
after	O

it	O
dawned	O
on	O
me	O
that	O
maybe	O
the	O

might	O
be	O
the	O

that	O
too.	O
I	O

including	O
a	O

because	O
I'm	O

I	O

because	O
I	O
can	O

that	O

I	O
walked	O

and	O
I've	O
gained	O

Two	O

put	O

Lipitor	B-DRU
10mg	O

it	O
went	O
down	O

BUT	O
I	O
started	O
having	O
terrible	O

in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

about	O
that	O

which	O
was	O

down	O

my	O

and	O
I	O
could	B-ADR
not	I-ADR

at	O
all.	O
I	O
lost	B-ADR
all	I-ADR
the	I-ADR

and	O
was	O

all	O

I	O
was	O
blaming	O
my	O

for	O
my	O

for	O
months	O
and	O
months.	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
extra	O
Relefen	B-DRU
and	O
Prednisone	B-DRU
which	O
helped	O
only	O
temporarly.	O
I	O
could	B-ADR
hardly	I-ADR
lift	I-ADR
a	I-ADR
glass	I-ADR
of	O
milk	O
without	O
using	O
both	O

I	O
was	O
so	O
weak	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
arms	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
hands.	O
One	O
day	O
it	O
just	O
hit	O
me.	O
Maybe	O
it's	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-DRU
.	O
It	O
was	O
the	O
newest	O
drug	O
I	O
was	O
taking.	O
So,	O
I	O
just	O
quit	O
taking	O
it	O
and	O
within	O
3	O
days	O
my	O
arm.	O
I	O
suggest	O
anyone	O
who	O
develops	O
a	O
bad	O
symption	O
within	O
a	O
week	O
or	O
month	O
of	O
going	O
on	O
Lipitor,	O
or	O
any	O
other	O
statin	O
drug,	O
quit	O
taking	O
it	O
and	O
call	O
your	O
doctor.	O
There	O
are	O
some	O
important	O
reasons	O
why	O
some	O
people	O
HAVE	O
to	O
be	O
on	O
a	O
statin	O
in	O
some	O
cases.	O

None	O
identified.	O
Currently	O
taking	O
20	O
mg/day.	O
Has	O
reduced	O
LDL	O
and	O
total	O
cholesterol	O
effectively	O
(latter	O
to	O
ca.	O
100),	O
but	O
HDL	O
is	O
still	O
low.	O

Back	B-ADR
pain,	O
Lipitor	B-DRU
seems	O
to	O
be	O
involved.	O
In	O
November	O
of	O
2005	O
I	O
was	O
prescribed	O
Lipitor	B-DRU
for	O
elevated	O
cholesterol.	O
Not	O
really	O
high,	O
but	O
high	O
enough,	O
dosage	O
was	O
only	O
20	O
mg	O
per	O
day.	O
Within	O
two	O
months,	O
I	O
had	O
developed	O
wicked	B-ADR
back	I-ADR
pain,	O
along	O
with	O
neuropathy	B-ADR
and	O
hypersensitivity	B-ADR
that	I-ADR
wrapped	I-ADR
around	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
abdomen.	O
We	O
suspected	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-DRU
was	O
involved,	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
off	O
it,	O
since	O
my	O
numbers	O
had	O
gotten	O
really	O
low.	O
I	O
was	O
effectively	O
laid	O
up	O
for	O
about	O
six	O
months.	O
Since	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
immediate	O
improvement,	O
we	O
surmised	O
that	O
Lipitor	B-DRU
wasn't	O
causing	O
this.	O
It's	O
October	O
2006	O
now,	O
and	O
I'm	O
starting	O
to	O
feel	O
more	O
like	O
myself,	O
still	O
hurts	O
but	O
I	O
can	O
work	O
around	O
it.	O
The	O
cholesterol	O
has	O
crept	O
up,	O
so	O
two	O
weeks	O
ago	O
we	O
started	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-DRU
again,	O
and	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
I	O
was	O
paractically	O
flat	O
on	O
my	O
back	O
again!	O
So,	O
I've	O
stopped	O
again.	O
It's	O
a	O
bloody	O
shame	O
this	O
is	O
happening,	O
as	O
the	O
drug	O
was	O
extremely	O
effective	O
in	O
dropping	O
that	O
cholesterol.	O
Too	O
bad,	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
try	O
something	O
else,	O
I	O
guess.	O

Tingling	B-ADR
all	O
over	O
my	O
body	O
and	O
numbness.	O

Terrible	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
hips	O
and	O
shoulders.	O
After	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-DRU
for	O
a	O
year,	O
I	O
started	O
having	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
hip.	O
Told	O
Dr	O
about	O
it,	O
he	O
didn't	O
seem	O
to	O
concerned.	O
After	O
about	O
1	O
1/2	O
years	O
I	O
started	O
having	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
shoulders.	O
The	O
pain	B-ADR
is	O
so	O
bad	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
that	O
it	O
wakes	O
me	O
up	O
at	O
night	O
and	O
extremely	B-ADR
limits	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
use	I-ADR
of	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
arms.	O
Dr	O
sent	O
me	O
for	O
x-rays,	O
MRI,	O
to	O
see	O
an	O
orthopedic	O
surgeon.	O
All	O
results	O
negative.	O
They	O
suggested	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
tendonitis	O
or	O
avascular	O
necrosis	O
and	O
recommended	O
anti-inflammatories.	O
Nobody	O
ever	O
suggested	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
drug	O
until	O
I	O
found	O
this	O
site	O
doing	O
research	O
on	O
my	O
pain.	O
It	O
makes	O
me	O
wonder	O
how	O
powerful	O
these	O
drug	O
companies	O
are	O
that	O
doctors	O
won't	O
even	O
suggest	O
that	O
the	O
drug	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
problem.	O
I'm	O
stopping	O
this	O
drug	O
today	O
in	O
the	O
hopes	O
that	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
goes	O
away.	O
Hopefully	O
I'll	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
play	O
catch	O
with	O
my	O
boys	O
and	O
swing	O
a	O

again	O
some	O

die	O
of	O
a	O
heart	O

from	O

in	O

I'd	O

muscle	B-ADR
problems	I-ADR
i.e.	O
your	O

this	O
is	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
they	O
put	O
younger	O
and	O
younger	O
people	O
on	O
these	O

I	O
would	O
recommend	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
your	O
own	O
research	O
versus	O
just	O
listening	O
to	O
the	O
doctor	O
who	O
wants	O
your	O
LDL	O
down	O
to	O
like	O
below	O
130,	O
neurosurgeons,	O
who	O
have	O
studied	O
this	O
would	O
tell	O
you	O
not	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
all	O
too	O
low.	O
And	O
just	O
because	O
your	O
test	O
come	O
back	O
and	O
show	O
your	O
liver	O
functions	O
are	O
fine	O
and	O
don't	O
show	O
any	O
broken	O
down	O
muscle	O
toxins	O
in	O
the	O

doesn't	O
mean	O
the	O
lack	O
of	O
CoQ10	O
isn't	O
breaking	O
down	O
and	O
damaging	B-ADR
your	I-ADR
muscles	I-ADR
very	O
slowly.	O
Mine	O
always	O
showed	O
fine	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
severe	B-ADR
arthritis	I-ADR
symptoms	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
knees	O
and	O
hip	O
joints	O
(never	O
had	O
this	O
in	O
my	O

and	O
bad	O
muscle	B-ADR
cramps	I-ADR
(also	O
never	O
got	O
those	O
until	O

Granted	O
is	O
you	O
have	O
high	O
blood	O
pressure,	O
high	B-DIS
LDL,	O
over	O
weight	O
and	O
maybe	O
smoke,	O
then	O
you	O
probably	O
need	O
something	O
to	O
lower	O
the	O
LDL,	O
if	O
you	O
only	O
have	O
high	O

you	O
don't.	O
Read	O
the	O
drug	O
company	O
studies,	O
they	O
even	O
say	O
it	O
may	O
help	O
prevent	O
a	O
heart	B-DIS
attack	I-DIS
when	O
you	O
have	O
3	O
of	O
the	O

risk	O
factors.	O

Went	O
to	O
hospital	O
for	O
my	O
Tmj	B-SYM
pain	I-SYM
because	O
it	O
was	O
getting	O
out	O
of	O
control.	O
A	O
doctor	O
prescribed	O
me	O
this	O
to	O
take	O
two	O
a	O
day.	O
One	O
pill	O
and	O
20	O
minutes	O
later	O
the	O
worse	O
period	B-ADR
cramps	I-ADR
in	O
my	O
life.	O
After	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
it	O
passed,	O
but	O
its	O
been	O
a	O
day	O
a	O
half	O
now,	O
and	O
i	O
still	O
feel	B-ADR
sick	I-ADR
after	O
eating	O
and	O
random	O
shooting	B-ADR
lower	I-ADR
abdominal	I-ADR
pains.	O
I'm	O
scared	O
to	O
death.	O

The	O
symptoms	O
got	O
progressively	O
worse	O
with	O
time.	O
They	O
included	O
fluid	B-ADR
retention,	O
all	O
over	O
muscle	B-ADR
pain,	O
cramps.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
them	O
a	O
week	O
ago	O
and	O
felt	O
much	O
better	O
the	O
next	O
day.	O
Some	O
of	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
haven't	O
totally	O
disappeared	O
but	O
I'm	O
improving	O
with	O
each	O
day.	O
My	O
doctor	O
doesn't	O
believe	O
that	O
this	O
medication	O
could	O
cause	O
this	O
reaction.	O

I	O
started	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-DRU
in	O
December	O
2009	O
and	O
stopped	O
after	O
4	O
months.	O
During	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
experienced	O
extreme	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
both	O
shoulders,	O
sometimes	O
in	O
the	O
neck	O
also,	O
causing	O
me	O
to	O
wake	O
several	O
times	O
each	O
night.	O
Pain	B-ADR
was	I-ADR
worse	I-ADR
in	O
the	O
morning	O
but	O
rarely	O
went	O
away	O
completely	O
during	O
the	O
day.	O
Most	O
mornings	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
wash	O
my	O
hair	O
in	O
the	O
shower	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
unable	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
reach	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
top	I-ADR
of	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
head	I-ADR
with	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
hands.	O
Pain	B-ADR
and	O
restricted	B-ADR
movement	I-ADR
often	O
prevented	O
me	O
from	O
putting	O
on	O
shoes	O
and	O
socks	O
without	O
assistance.	O
In	O
January	O
this	O
year	O
I	O
started	O
experiencing	O
discomfort	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
left	I-ADR
hand	I-ADR
for	O
the	O
first	O
time.	O
Now	O
in	O
both	O
hands,	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
has	O
increased,	O
fingers	B-ADR
are	I-ADR
swollen	I-ADR
and	O
movement	B-ADR
is	I-ADR
restricted.	O
My	O
wife	O
tells	O
me	O
my	O
hands	B-ADR
are	I-ADR
warm	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
touch.	O
The	O
mornings	O
are	O
worse	O
when	O
they	O
hurt	O
the	O
most,	O
movement	B-ADR
is	I-ADR
restricted	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
it	I-ADR
is	I-ADR
impossible	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
make	I-ADR
a	I-ADR
fist.	O
Ice	O
and	O
ibruprofen	B-DRU
gel	I-DRU
help	O
but	O
only	O
for	O
a	O
short	O
while.	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
taking	O
400	O
mg	O
Ibruprofen	B-DRU
3	O
times	O
daily	O
for	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
weeks	O
on	O
my	O
doctors	O
advice	O
without.	O
This	O
drug	O
is	O
clearly	O
POISON	O
to	O
so	O
many	O
people	O
and	O
perhaps	O
there	O
is	O
good	O
reason	O
to	O
take	O
Pfizer	O
to	O
the	O
courts.	O
However	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
that	O
any	O
Doctor	O
prescribing	O
Lipitor	B-DRU
should	O
make	O
it	O
abundantly	O
clear	O
to	O
the	O
patient	O
that	O
very	O
serious	O
consequences	O
could	O
ensue	O
that	O
would	O
cause	O
extreme	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
and	O
could	O
effect	O
quality	O
of	O
life.	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
failure	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
is	O
a	O
serious	O
deriliction	O
of	O
duty	O
that	O
should	O
be	O
tested	O
with	O
complaints	O
to	O
the	O
medical	O
authorities	O
that	O
oversee	O
our	O
doctors	O
and/or	O
the	O
courts.	O

worked	O
very	O
well;	O
it	O
took	O
about	O
a	O
month	O
for	O
noticeable	O
results,	O
but	O
the	O
relief	O
was	O
definite	O
and	O
lasting.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
after	O
4-5	O
months	O
-	O
shoulder	O
remained	O
ok,	O
but	O
many	O
lesser	O
aches	B-SYM
and	O
pains	B-SYM
(back,	O
knees,	O
etc)	O
returned.	O
Clearly,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
systemic	O
effect	O
that	O
was	O
helpful	O
as	O
well.	O

I	O
agree	O
with	O

many	O

you	O

I	O
cannot	O
believe	O
the	O
immediate	O
difference	O
this	O

had	O
made	O
in	O

I	O
could	O

I	O

which	O
I	O
wasn't	O
noticing	O

before,	O

this	O
may	O
be	O
due	O
to	O

I'm	O
now	O
in	O
my	O
early	O

I've	O
started	O

Some	O

that	O

Possibly	O
diarrhea	B-ADR
and	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain,	O
but	O
most	O

none	O
because	O
I	O

a	O
sinus	B-DIS

definitely	O

then	O
2x/day	O

was	O
immediately	O
worse	O

It	O
does	O

the	O
pain	B-SYM
in	I-SYM
my	I-SYM
knee,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O

but	O
I'm	O
afraid	O
that	O
the	O
drug	O
is	O
masking	O
the	O
pain	B-SYM
which	O
enables	O
me	O
to	O
overexert	O
my	O

and	O
cause	O
more	O

This	O
really	O
makes	O
me	O

I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O

and	O
getting	O
off	O
this	O

immediately!!!!	O
Even	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
the	O

approx	O
5years	O

Had	O
an	O

6months	O

with	O

which	O
I	O
suspect	O

due	O
to	O
Lipitor.	O
Started	O
on	O
20mg	O
and	O
progressed	O
to	O
80mg.	O

just	O
took	O
the	O

about	O
30	O
minutes	O

the	O

combined.	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
keep	O
dropping	O
into	O
a	O

due	O
to	O
the	O
severity	O
of	O
the	O
lower	B-ADR
abdominal	I-ADR
pain.	O
i	O
was	O
put	O
on	O
this	O
medication	O
because	O
i	O
was	O
taking	O
such	O
high	O
doses	O
of	O
Advil	B-DRU
to	O
quell	O
the	O
inflammation	B-SYM
in	I-SYM
my	I-SYM

that	O
it	O
caused	O

after	O
this	O

this	O

the	O

(hair	O

I	O
decided	O
to	O
stop	O
all	O
the	O

I	O
am	O
fed	O
up	O
with	O
all	O
those	O

ALL	O
induce	O

for	O
which	O
your	O

will	O

That	O
is	O
when	O

My	O

I	O

not	I-ADR

even	I-ADR

When	O

my	O

stopped	O

immediately	O
and	O
I	O
lost	O
4	O

without	O

anything	O

You	O
completely	O
destroy	O

Now	O

I	O
am	O
going	O

I	O

good	O

NOT	O
the	O

Take	O

It	O
is	O
time.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
same	O
poster	O
as	O
the	O
previous	O
posting.	O
I	O
notice	O
a	O
poster	O
attributed	O
Bell's	B-DIS
palsy	I-DIS
to	O
lipitor.	O
I	O
too	O
had	O
Bell's,	O
I	O
went	O
back	O
and	O
looked	O
at	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
chart	O
and	O
found	O
I	O
got	O
Bell's	B-DIS
before	O
I	O
started	O
on	O
lipitor.	O
There	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
consistent	O
occurence	O
of	O
muscle	O
pain	O
and/or	O
liver	O
problems	O
but	O
I	O
wonder	O
how	O
many	O
other	O
problems	O
are	O
not	O
really	O
attributable	O
to	O
lipitor	B-DRU
eg	O
see	O
my	O
Bell's	B-DIS
palsy.	O
Also	O
I	O
get	O
night	B-ADR
muscle	I-ADR
cramps	I-ADR
but	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
occasional	O
muscle	O
cramps	O
at	O
night	O
since	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
child,	O
Maybe	O
my	O
memory	O
isn't	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
I'm	O
70	O
and	O
I	O
still	O
passed	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
hardest	O
bar	O
exams	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
less	O
than	O
2	O
years	O
ago.	O
However	O
I	O
don't	O
doubt	O
that	O
some	O
unlucky	O
people	O
are	O
having	O
bad	O
side	O
effects,	O
I	O
just	O
wonder	O
about	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
more	O
esoteric	O
ones.	O

Definitely	O
short	B-ADR
term	I-ADR
memory	I-ADR
issues,	O
but	O
I'm	O
44	O
and	O
I	O
suppose	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
part	O
of	O
menopause	O
on	O
its	O
way.	O
lowered	O
overall	O
cholesterol	O
and	O
my	O
hdl	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
59	O
from	O
35,	O
and	O
triglycerides	O
went	O
down	O
but	O
not	O
enough.	O
LDL	O
down	O
too	O
but	O
not	O
enough	O
so	O
taking	O
higher	O
dose	O
now.	O
Worked	O
like	O
a	O
champ	O
at	O
10	O
mg	O
for	O
first	O
two	O
years.	O
Now	O
switched	O
from	O
GP	O
to	O
cardiologist	O
and	O
he's	O
upped	O
it	O
to	O
40	O
mg	O
so	O
will	O
see.	O
have	O
only	O
taken	O
3	O
tablets	O
since	O
new	O
dosage.	O

Still	O
have	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR

Took	O
Liptor	B-DRU

3	O

Developed	O

Took	O
myself	O
off	O
Liptor	B-DRU
and	O
all	O

away.	O
Then	O
my	O

had	O
a	O
bright	O
idea	O
to	O
try	O
Liptor	B-DRU
again	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
symtoms	O
came	O
back.	O
Problem	O
is,	O
went	O
off	O
this	O
drug	O
and	O
I	O
still	O
have	O
muscle	B-ADR
problem	I-ADR
and	O
at	O
times	O
can	B-ADR
hardly	I-ADR

Now	O
the	O

starts	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
feel	I-ADR
very	I-ADR

then	I-ADR
get	I-ADR

and	I-ADR
lastly	I-ADR
it	I-ADR
starts	I-ADR
to	I-ADR

very	I-ADR

(Like	I-ADR
the	I-ADR

This	O

I	O
just	O
want	O
to	O

I	O

2-3	O

only	O
took	O
1	O

once	O
a	O

for	O
two	O

I	O
found	O
that	O
Voltaren	B-DRU
took	O

all	O
my	O

i	O
rarely	O
use	O

because	O
i	O
find	O
it	O
never	O

just	O
"""soldier"	O

my	O

have	O
noticed	O

I	O

this	O

I	O

what	O
are	O
they	O
doing	O
to	O
us,	O
in	O
the	O

us?	O
I	O
did	O
take	O
the	O
actual	O
lipitor	B-DRU
for	O
several	O
yrs,	O
and	O
it	O
did	O
lower	O
cholesteral,	O
but	O
started	O
experiencing	O
the	O
muscle	B-ADR
tingley	I-ADR
thing	I-ADR
and	O
stopped	O
,	O
then	O
started	O
with	O
the	O
Atorvastatin,	O
where	O
i	O
noticed	O
the	O
above	O
side	O
affects.	O
be	O
very	O
aware	O
of	O
any	O
physical/emotional	O
changes.	O

Just	O
before	O
this	O
last	O
Christmas	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
small	O
stroke	B-DIS
and	O
spent	O
three	O

in	O
the	O

To	O
make	O
a	O

there	O
are	O
no	O

of	O
the	O

In	O

the	O
symptoms	O
went	O
away.	O
But,	O
my	O
Doc	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
Aggrenox	O
and	O
20mg	O
of	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
have	O
very	O
high	O
arches	O
and	O
have	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
tingling	B-ADR
in	O
my	O

for	O

This	O
is	O
really	O
helped	O
with	O
a	O

for	O
the	O

two	O

the	O
pain	B-ADR
in	O
my	O
feet	O
and	O
calves	O
(and	O
sometimes	O

has	O
gotten	O
much	O
worse.	O
I	O
cannot	B-ADR
walk	I-ADR
very	O
far	O
and	O
sleeping	O
has	O
become	O
a	O
problem	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
pain.	O
Because	O
of	O
the	O
preexisting	O
arch	B-DIS
problem,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
naturally	O
getting	O
worse	O
but	O
after	O

this	O

I	O

it	O
is	O

I	O
