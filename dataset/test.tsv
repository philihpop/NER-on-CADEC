and	O
I	O
know	O
now	O
that	O
I	O

them.	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
Lipitor	O
40	O
mg.	O
for	O
some	O
years	O
now.	O
It	O
did	O
help	O
my	O
reduction	O
of	O
highg	O
cholesterol.	O
It	O
was	O
also	O
a	O
gradual	O
onset	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
above	O
mentioned;	O
This	O
is.	O

I	O
was	O
prescribed	O
Zipsor	O
for	O
bone	O
and	O
joint	O
pain	O
associated	O
with	O
Lupus.	O
I	O
also	O
have	O
3	O
herniated	O
discs	O
that	O
have	O
been	O
bothering	O
me	O
for	O
years,	O
and	O
for	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
always	O
taken	O
a	O
low	O
dose	O
of	O
Vicodin	O
(almost	O
daily).	O
The	O
Zipsor	O
works	O
well	O
on	O
the	O
Lupus	O
pain,	O
but	O
also	O
almost	O
completely	O
wiped	O
out	O
the	O
pain	O
from	O
the	O
herniated	O
discs,	O
and	O
has	O
replaced	O
my	O
usual	O
narcotic	O
pain	O
relief	O
for	O
my	O
back.	O
As	O
with	O
any	O
disc	O
issues	O
there	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
occasional	O
flare	O
up,	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
do	O
occur	O
now	O
they	O
are	O
minor,	O
and	O
once	O
I	O
take	O
my	O
usual	O
dose	O
of	O
Zipsor,	O
the	O
pain	O
is	O
gone	O
again.	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
no	O
recognizable	O
side	O
effects.	O

Stopped	O
pain	O
and	O
muscle	O
spasms	O
the	O
next	O
day!	O
I	O
now	O
take	O
it	O
as	O
necessary.	O
I	O
also	O
take	O
a	O

with	O
this.	O
It	O
is	O

it	O

Swollen	O

The	O

the	O

occasionally	O

Had	O
to	O
remove	O

to	O
get	O

Quit	O

over	O

the	O

for	O

Some	O

I	O

taking	O
it	O

of	O
the	O

I	O
was	O

could	O

With	O

I	O

I	O

I	O

After	O
being	O
on	O
10	O
mg	O
of	O
Lipitor	O
for	O
about	O
3	O
years,	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
experience	O
speech	O
and	O
swallowing	O
problems	O
which	O
got	O
worse	O
while	O
I	O
continued	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
as	O
recommended	O
by	O
my	O
physician.	O
After	O
6	O
months,	O
my	O
speech	O
and	O
swallowing	O
were	O
so	O
bad	O
that	O
I	O
stopped	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O
It	O
is	O
now	O
one	O
year	O
after	O
stopping	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
diagnosed	O
with	O
ALS	O
(which	O
tests	O
later	O
verified	O
was	O
incorrect)	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
beginning	O
to	O
improve	O
in	O
speech	O
and	O
swallowing.	O
but	O
very	O
slowly	O
and	O
I	O
may	O
never	O
get	O
back	O
to	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
before	O
Lipitor.	O
It	O
has	O
also	O
affected	O
my	O
memory.	O
Had	O
Pfizer	O
just	O
mentioned	O
in	O
their	O
precautions	O
that	O
Lipitor	O
just	O
might	O
cause	O
speech	O
and	O
swallowing	O
problems,	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
stopped	O
taking	O
statin	O
drugs	O
6	O
months	O
earlier	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
OK	O
again.	O

This	O
medicine	O
completely	O
relieves	O
my	O
thumb	O
pain,	O
and	O
really	O
helps	O
with	O
my	O
back	O
pain.	O
BUT,	O
it	O
makes	O
my	O
stomach	O
hurt	O
soooo	O
bad	O
that	O
I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
what	O
is	O
worse.	O
I	O
only	O
use	O
it	O
when	O
my	O
thumbs	O
hurt	O
so	O
bad	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
cry.	O
Then	O
I	O
put	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
stomach	O
pain.	O
It	O
also	O
give	O
you	O
diarrhea	O
but	O
I	O
can	O
handle	O
that.	O

This	O
drug	O
MAY	O
have	O
caused	O
edema	O
of	O
fingers	O
and	O
face	O
after	O
taking	O
for	O
4	O
days.	O
Also	O
may	O
have	O
caused	O
shortness	O
of	O
breath.	O
Also	O
some	O
crabbiness	O
and	O
cramping	O
(as	O
in	O
menstrual)	O
and	O
spotting.	O
Timing	O
off	O
for	O
a	O
true	O
period,	O
so	O
suspect	O
Voltaren	O
is	O
the	O
culprit.	O
Took	O
one	O
50	O
mg	O
pill	O
each	O
day	O
for	O
5	O
days.	O
The	O
first	O
day	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
make	O
all	O
the	O
pain	O
of	O
a	O
muscle	O
spasm	O
in	O
shoulder	O
go	O
away.	O
It	O
almost	O
seemed	O
like	O
a	O
miracle.	O
The	O
effects	O
diminished	O
each	O
day	O
(I	O
have	O
pain	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O
time)	O
and	O
now	O
my	O
face	O
and	O
fingers	O
are	O
swollen	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
short	O
of	O
breath,	O
cramping	O
and	O
bloated.	O
Interesting	O
to	O
see	O
females	O
posting	O
similar	O
troubles.	O
I	O
will	O
NEVER	O
take	O
another	O
one	O
of	O
these.	O

severe	O
muscle	O
pain	O
in	O
hips,	O
legs	O
and	O
ankles.	O
It	O
helps	O
lower	O
my	O
cholesterol,	O
but	O
recks	O
my	O
muscles	O
severly.	O
I	O
take	O
a	O
6week	O
break	O
and	O
resume	O
dosage	O
of	O
lipitor.	O

I've	O
been	O
taking	O
LIPITOR	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
(had	O
been	O
on	O
Baycol),.	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
years	O
ago,	O
I	O
began	O
experiencing	O
increasing	O
joint	O
and	O
muscle	O
pain	O
that	O
is	O
now	O
so	O
severe	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
wodering	O
if	O
it's	O
worth	O
living	O
with	O
such	O
pain.	O
I'm	O
very	O
depressed.	O
The	O
pain	O
is	O
often	O
so	O
severe	O
that	O
it	O
limits	O
my	O
ability	O
to	O
walk	O
and	O
climb	O
stairs,	O
to	O
lift	O
anything	O
heavier	O
than	O
a	O
few	O
pounds.	O
I've	O
had	O
some	O
excruciating	O
thigh	O
cramps,	O
and	O
more	O
recently,	O
I	O
have	O
noticed	O
a	O
generalized	O
weakness	O
all	O
over	O
my	O
body.	O
It	O
scares	O
me	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
some	O
statin	O
drug	O
because	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
was	O
very	O
high	O
without	O
them,	O
but	O
my	O
quality	O
of	O
life	O
is	O
so	O
drastically	O
affected	O
that	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
have	O
to.	O
I	O
believe	O
it's	O
very	O
dangerous	O
stuff.	O

Calf	O
muscle	O
strains.	O
Had	O
been	O
taking	O
20mg	O
3x/wk	O
with	O
excellent	O
cholesterol	O
reduction	O
for	O
1	O
yr+.	O
Have	O
also	O
been	O
running	O
2-3/wk	O
during	O
same	O
time.	O
3	O
mos	O
ago	O
got	O
muscle	O
strain	O
in	O
right	O
calf	O
that	O
lasted	O
4	O
months.	O
One	O
month	O
ago	O
got	O
severe	O
muscle	O
pull/strain	O
in	O
left	O
calf.	O
Each	O
time	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
to	O
quit	O
running	O
for	O
several	O
wks.	O
Just	O
tonight	O
did	O
I	O
do	O
a	O
web	O
search	O
on	O
lipitor	O
and	O
calf	O
pain	O
and	O
now	O
am	O
pretty	O
convinced	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
Lipitor	O
from	O
all	O
I	O
have	O
read	O
on	O
this	O
site.	O
Was	O
collegiate	O
distance	O
runner	O
and	O
have	O
run	O
off	O
and	O
on	O
for	O
years	O
-	O
NEVER	O
in	O
25	O
yrs	O
have	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
pulled/strained	O
calf	O
till	O
now!	O
Will	O
stop	O
Lipitor	O
for	O
now	O
and	O
try	O
to	O
resume	O
running	O
-once	O
my	O
muscle	O
pull	O
heals	O
and	O
hopefully	O
it	O
won't	O
recur.	O

I	O
have	O
nothing	O
yet	O
just	O
took	O
it	O
my	O
first	O
time,	O
but	O
I	O
am	O
also	O
on	O
occupycet	O
5/325Nguyen	O
I	O
have	O
bad	O
back	O
and	O
knew	O
pain	O
has	O
anyone	O
been	O
onthe	O
same	O
pills	O
just	O
felling	O
really	O
tied	O
now	O
clicking	O
in	O
this	O
new	O
pill.	O

Anxiety,	O
paranoia.	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
see	O
my	O
doctor	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
about	O
my	O
discovery.	O
First	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
reluctant	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
following	O
meeting	O
he	O
already	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
read	O
about	O
Lipitor's	O
psychiatric	O
side	O
effects.	O
He	O
therefore	O
put	O
me	O
off	O
Lipitor	O
completely	O
and	O
suggested	O
a	O
much	O
lower	O
dosage	O
of	O
10mg	O
Crestor.	O
In	O
addition,	O
he	O
prescribed	O
a	O
new	O
medication:	O
Niacin,	O
beginning	O
with	O
500mg	O
the	O
first	O
month	O
and	O
then	O
increasing	O
to	O
1,000	O
in	O
the	O
second	O
(with	O
the	O
ultimate	O
aim	O
of	O
reaching	O
2,000	O
in	O
the	O
fourth	O
monthly).	O
Bottom	O
line:	O
When	O
I	O
discontinued	O
Lipitor	O
two	O
months	O
ago	O
my	O
LDL	O
reached	O
165.	O
This	O
week	O
my	O
blood	O
test	O
indicated	O
an	O
LDL	O
level	O
of	O
124.	O
So,	O
after	O
being	O
helped	O
by	O
folks	O
on	O
this	O
website	O
I	O
hope	O
I	O
can	O
be	O
of	O
some	O
help	O
to	O
others	O
who	O
suffer	O
from	O
statin	O
side	O
effects.	O
Therefore,	O
here	O
is	O
what	O
I've	O
done	O
during	O
the	O
past	O
two	O
months:	O
-	O
Took	O
500mg	O
of	O
Niacin	O
during	O
the	O
first	O
months	O
and	O
1,000mg	O
during	O
the	O
second;	O
-	O
Took	O
a	O
total	O
of	O
10	O
Crestor	O
pills	O
(10mg	O
which	O
are	O
equivalent	O
to	O
20mg	O
of	O
Lipitor)	O
per	O
month,	O
i.e.,	O
one	O
every	O
three	O
days.	O
-	O
Two	O
natural	O
pills	O
of	O
Phytosterol.	O
-	O
A	O
cup	O
of	O
tea	O
made	O
of	O
olive	O
leafs.	O
Now,	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
reach	O
the	O
maximum	O
intake	O
of	O
Niacin	O
in	O
two	O
months	O
(2,000mg)	O
the	O
LDL	O
will	O
drop	O
from	O
124	O
to	O
100	O
(the	O
level	O
required	O
for	O
diabetics).	O
Good	O

me	O
that	O
someone	O

is	O
recommending	O
SIMVISTATIN	O
as	O
an	O
alternative	O
to	O
LIPITOR.	O
Up	O
until	O
3	O
weeks	O
ago	O
I	O
was	O
taking	O
LIPEX	O
which	O
is	O
SIMVISTATIN	O
-	O
it	O
reduced	O
my	O

very	O
satisfactorily.	O
However	O

in	O
hips	O
cannot	O

even	O
a	O
short	O

-	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O

A	O

was	O
on	O

and	O
informed	O
me	O
there	O
could	O
be	O
a	O
connection	O
-	O
I	O

this	O

amazed	O
at	O
all	O
the	O

I	O

MAD!!!	O
I	O

3	O

picking	O
up,	O
but	O
hip	O
pain	O
still	O
throbbing.	O
I	O
also	O
felt	O
like	O
an	O
old	O
woman,	O
I	O
have	O
over	O
the	O
years	O
been	O
to	O
physiotherapists	O
and	O
chiropractors	O
who	O
did	O
not	O

what	O
to	O
do	O
-	O
recently	O
diagnosed	O
with	O

in	O
the	O

Doctor	O

be	O

of	O
STATIN	O
drug	O
-	O
has	O
insisted	O
I	O
need	O
my	O

to	O
-	O
has	O
now	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
BEZALIP	O
(no	O

STATINS	O
so	O
I	O
am	O
told)	O
I	O
haven't	O
filled	O
the	O
script	O
yet	O
-	O
need	O
to	O
do	O
more	O
research.	O
My	O
heart	O
goes	O
out	O
to	O
all	O
of	O
you!.	O

severe	O
pain	O
in	O
buttocks	O
and	O
left	O
leg	O
Sciatica	O
like	O
symptoms.	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
if	O
it	O
helped	O
anything.	O
Felt	O
no	O
difference	O
except	O
sudden	O
onset	O
of	O
pain	O
after	O
one	O
month.	O
Couldn't	O
sleep.	O

First	O
the	O
doc	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
gastritis	O
from	O
pain	O
in	O
my	O
abdomen,	O
headaches,	O
flushing	O
-	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
abdominal	O
ultrasound,	O
endoscopy,	O
then	O
CT	O
scans	O
(2)	O
and	O
then	O
yesterday	O
an	O
MRI	O
-	O
all	O
were	O
normal.	O
The	O
fatigue,	O
muscle	O
pain,	O
headaches,	O
and	O
general	O
malaise	O
continue.	O
I	O
am	O
taking	O
myself	O
off	O
this	O
drug	O
and	O
hope	O
that	O
my	O
apparently	O
healthy	O
body	O
recovers.	O
Why	O
is	O
my	O
doctor	O
unaware	O
of	O
the	O
Lipitor	O
side	O
effects?	O
Why	O
did	O
I	O
spend	O
almost	O
$1,000	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
money	O
AFTER	O
insurance	O
on	O
all	O
these	O
tests	O
without	O
considering	O
that	O
my	O
symptoms	O
match	O
those	O
for	O
Lipitor?	O
So	O
frustrating!	O
I	O
will	O
check	O
back	O
in	O
and	O
document	O
how	O
I	O
feel	O
in	O
a	O
month.	O

Happiness.	O
This	O
stuff	O
really	O
works.	O
After	O
months	O
of	O
taking	O
other	O
medication,	O
that	O
was	O
turning	O
me	O
into	O
a	O
zombie,	O
I	O
had	O
relief	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
an	O
hour.	O

On	O
lipitor	O
for	O
4	O
years.	O
Reduced	O
cholesterol	O
levels	O
to	O
normal	O
BUT	O
since	O
taking	O
lipitor	O
I've	O
developed	O
horrible	O
pain	O
in	O
both	O
shoulders	O
and	O
left	O
knee.	O
Sleeping	O
has	O
become	O
extemely	O
difficult	O
due	O
to	O
pain.	O
Have	O
to	O
sleep	O
in	O
a	O
chair	O
most	O
nights.	O
Orthopedist	O
seems	O
to	O
think	O
its	O
normal	O
aging	O
(I'm	O
only	O
55)	O
and	O
internist	O
is	O
skeptical	O
that	O
lipitor	O
is	O
the	O
culprit.	O
I	O
have	O
also	O
noticed	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
short	O
term	O
memory	O
loss	O
and	O
am	O
easily	O
fatigued.	O
After	O
reading	O
the	O
entries	O
on	O
this	O
site	O
I'm	O
stopping	O
the	O
lipitor	O
today	O
and	O
we'll	O
see	O
the	O
result.	O

extreme	O
muscle	O
spazms	O
in	O
my	O
lower	O
back,	O
eye	O
sight	O
changes,	O
fatigue	O
and	O
weakness.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
the	O
drup	O
almost	O
two	O
weeks	O
ago	O
and	O
my	O
back	O
pain	O
is	O
beginning	O
to	O
go	O
away.	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
recommend	O
this	O
drug	O
even	O
though	O
it	O
did	O
work	O
to	O
lower	O
my	O
cholesterol.	O

After	O
a	O
few	O
months	O
of	O
Lipitor	O
and	O
Tricor	O
started	O
having	O
abdominal	O
pain,	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
G.I.	O
problems,	O
recently	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
E.R.	O
with	O
severe	O
chest	O
pain	O
and	O
now	O
am	O
waiting	O
for	O
Cardio	O
related	O
tests.	O
I	O
think	O
these	O
drugs	O
really	O
screwed	O
me	O
up.	O
Don't	O
use	O
statin	O
drugs.	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
dangerous!!.	O

muscle	O
spasms	O
effects	O
like	O
very	O
bad	O
restless	O
leg	O
syndrome.	O
after	O
3	O
days	O
on	O
this	O
drug	O
I	O
was	O
unable	O
to	O
sleep	O
due	O
to	O
symptoms	O
like	O
a	O
very	O
bad	O
attack	O
of	O
Restless	O
Leg	O
Syndrome.	O
Then	O
symptoms	O
stated	O
during	O
day	O
too,	O
my	O
legs	O
have	O
been	O
twitching	O
all	O
the	O
time.	O
I	O
looked	O
up	O
possible	O
side	O
effectsand	O
after	O
reading	O
this	O
page	O
realized	O
what	O
the	O
problem	O
was,	O
I	O
have	O
now	O
stopped	O
the	O
drug	O
and	O
am	O
waiting	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
happens.	O

I	O
have	O
done	O
very	O
well	O
with	O
Lipitor	O
for	O
the	O
last	O
2	O
1/2	O
years.	O
It	O
has	O
reduced	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
significantly-from	O
over	O
300	O
to	O
under	O
150.	O
Two	O
weeks	O
ago	O
I	O
was	O
given	O
the	O
new	O
generic.	O
This	O
week	O
I	O
noticed	O
that	O
all	O
my	O
fingers	O
and	O
toes	O
were	O
tingling,	O
a	O
pins	O
and	O
needles	O
feeling.	O
It	O
was	O
like	O
they	O
had	O
fallen	O
asleep.	O
I	O
immediately	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
pharmacy	O
and	O
got	O
brand	O
name	O
again	O
(luckily	O
my	O
insurance	O
pays-it	O
will	O
be	O
$15/	O
3	O
month	O
supply	O
more,	O
but	O
it's	O
worth	O
it).	O
I	O
have	O
noticed	O
just	O
within	O
the	O
last	O
two	O
days	O
the	O
tingling	O
is	O
gone.	O
Thank	O
goodness!	O
I	O
read	O
that	O
generics	O
have	O
the	O
same	O
active	O
ingredients,	O
but	O
there	O
may	O
be	O
a	O
difference	O
in	O
how	O
the	O
medicine	O
is	O
released.	O
It's	O
not	O
EXACTLY	O
the	O
same.	O
High	O
cholesterol	O
runs	O
in	O
my	O
family	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
greatful	O
that	O
Lipitor	O
can	O
help	O
me	O
manage	O
this.	O

Took	O
for	O
2	O
weeks.	O
Towards	O
the	O
end,	O
began	O
getting	O
tightness	O
in	O
my	O
throat,	O
tingling	O
eyes	O
and	O
lips.	O
These	O
symptoms	O
worsened	O
over	O
the	O
following	O
two	O
weeks,	O
especially	O
the	O
tightness	O
in	O
my	O
throat	O
until	O
a	O
severe	O

resulted	O
in	O
me	O
colapsing	O
from	O
a	O
heart	O

and	O
hospitalised	O
for	O
a	O
week.	O

it.	O

It	O
did	O
lower	O
my	O

but	O
is	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
side	O
effects.	O
I	O
have	O
stopped	O

it	O
and	O
will	O
just	O

for	O
me.	O
I	O

when	O
nothing	O

I	O
take	O

it.	O
It	O

I	O
took	O
it	O
for	O
about	O
3	O

before	O
I	O
started	O
feeling	O
any	O

I	O
didn't	O

this	O

the	O

until	O
I	O
researched	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
side	O
effects	O
had	O
been	O
encountered.	O
It	O
was	O
pretty	O
shocking	O
when	O
I	O
found	O
out	O
I	O
was	O
suffering	O
from	O
half	O
of	O
those	O

And	O
I	O
just	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
a.	O

Possible	O
body	O
stiffness	O
and	O
joint	O
pain.	O

Took	O
10	O
mg.	O
for	O
two	O
years	O
with	O
no	O
problems,	O
then	O
started	O
to	O
have	O
burning,numb	O
feet	O
in	O
toe	O
area	O
-	O
both	O
feet.	O
Also,	O
had	O
discomfort	O
in	O
right	O

of	O

area.	O
After	O
assorted	O

which	O
were	O
all	O
normal,	O
read	O
an	O
article	O
regarding	O
neurophathy	O
and	O

Stopped	O
the	O
Lipitor	O
and	O
slowly	O
the	O

went	O
away,	O
but	O
two	O
years	O

my	O

are	O
still	O
a	O

Would	O

Left	O
shoulder	O

and	O
right	O
hip	O
and	O
muscle	O
pain	O
over	O
3	O
weeks.	O
I'm	O
a	O
physician	O
and	O
initially	O
figured	O
the	O
pain	O
was	O
sports	O
related	O
(although	O
being	O
right	O
handed,	O
I	O
was	O
suspicious	O
about	O
the	O
unilateral	O
left	O
shoulder	O
pain).	O
I	O
stuck	O
it	O
out	O
for	O
3	O
weeks	O
until	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
significant	O
limp.	O
Then	O
stopped	O
Lipitor	O
3	O
days	O
ago	O
and	O
noticed	O
a	O
very	O
significant	O
mitigation	O
of	O
the	O
pain	O
-	O
about	O
80%	O
resolved	O
already.	O
The	O
drug	O
worked	O
wonders	O
on	O
cholesterol	O
(down	O
80	O
in	O
4	O
months),	O
but	O
I'll	O
be	O

an	O

shortly.	O

on	O
my	O
stomach.	O
On	O
my	O
10th	O
day	O
of	O
medication,	O
I	O
experienced	O
vaginal	O
bleeding.	O
This	O
scared	O
me	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
two	O
weeks	O
after	O
my	O
normal	O
period.	O
There	O
is	O
something	O
really	O
fishy	O
about	O
this	O
drug.	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
advise	O
anyone	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
as	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
adverse	O
side	O
effects.	O

It	O
either	O
caused	O
or	O
gave	O
me	O
peripheral	O
neuropathy	O
in	O
my	O
hands,	O
arms,	O
feet	O
and	O
legs.	O
And	O
it	O
damaged	O
my	O
liver.	O
No	O
one	O
should	O
ever	O
take	O
a	O
statin.	O
It	O
should	O
be	O
taken	O
off	O
the	O
market.	O

I	O
thought	O
I	O
was	O
having	O
a	O
heart	O
attack	O
-	O
went	O
to	O
emergency	O
room.	O
Problem	O
began	O
while	O
sitting	O
at	O
this	O
computer.	O
quick,	O
sharp	O
pain	O
in	O
center	O
of	O
chest,	O
followed	O
by	O
a	O
hot/heated	O
flushing	O
sensation	O
that	O
began	O
mid-torso	O
and	O
continued	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
head	O
(top	O
of	O
scalp	O
started	O
tingling	O
and	O
burning).	O
Oddest	O
feeling	O
that	O
I've	O
ever	O
experienced	O
-	O
very	O
scary.	O
Lasted	O
approximately	O
45	O
seconds,	O
followed	O
by	O
feeling	O
of	O
weakness	O
and	O
impending	O
doom.	O
By	O
the	O
time	O
I	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
hospital	O
I	O
was	O
shaking	O
with	O
chills	O
uncontrollably.	O
After	O
tests	O
were	O
run	O
I	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
it	O
wasn't	O
a	O
heart	O
attack	O
or	O
shroke.	O
They	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
probably	O
related	O
to	O
stress	O
or	O
a	O
panic	O
attack	O
--	O
ridiculous	O
because	O
I	O
haven't	O
been	O
stressed	O
and	O
have	O
never	O
had	O
any	O
problem	O
similar.	O
Definitely	O
helped	O
lower	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
from	O
263	O
to	O
164	O
--	O
amazing,	O
but	O
I'm	O
afraid	O
to	O
continue	O
taking	O
due	O
to	O
experiencing	O

severe	O

a	O

Now	O
after	O
2+	O

noticed	O
my	O

was	O
bothering	O
me	O
so	O
that	O
sometimes	O
I	O
had	O
to	O

a	O

Thought	O
I	O
might	O
need	O
hip	O
replacement	O
(age	O

but	O
it	O
dawned	O
on	O
me	O
that	O
maybe	O
the	O
Lipitor	O
might	O
be	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
that	O
too.	O
I	O
cut	O

again	O
in	O
half	O
and	O

only	O

Now	O

experienced	O

acute	O
back	O

which	O
gradually	O
improved	O
but	O
seemed	O

to	O

anything	O
to	O

My	O

for	O
about	O
two	O

and	O
may	O

the	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
had	O

(over	O

was	O
prescribed	O
Lipitor	O
in	O
1996	O
after	O
other	O
methods	O
failed	O
to	O

I	O
have	O
taken	O
two	O

tests	O
over	O
the	O

ten	O

was	O
told	O
I	O
had	O
a	O

with	O

I	O
am	O
6'	O

considered	O

until	O

I	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
pass	O
a	O
physical	O
readiness	O
test,	O
including	O
a	O
1.5	O
mile	O
run,	O
every	O
6	O
months	O
because	O
I'm	O
in	O
the	O
military.	O
I	O
took	O
myself	O
off	O
Lipitor	O
because	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
take	O
the	O
physical	O
readiness	O
test.	O
In	O
fact	O
I	O
need	O
a	O

in	O
the	O
morning	O
to	O
get	O
out	O

I	O
am	O
not	O

I	O
was	O
told	O
to	O
stretch	O
and	O
exercise	O
more	O
but	O
that	O
has	O
not	O
helped	O
my	O
symptoms,	O
which	O
have	O
continued	O
to	O
worsen.	O
Until	O
recently	O
I	O
walked	O
to	O
work	O
and	O
shopping,	O
4	O
or	O
5	O
miles	O
most	O
weekdays,	O
and	O
more	O
on	O

I	O
also	O
ran	O
2	O

3	O

a	O

Now	O
I	O
have	O
difficulty	O
walking	O
and	O
problems	O
with	O
my	O
balance	O
and	O
I've	O
gained	O
10	O
pounds	O
because	O
I've	O
become	O
sedentary.	O
Two	O
days	O
after	O
taking	O
myself	O
off	O
Lipitor	O
my	O
feet	O
have	O
improved	O
a	O
little	O
and	O
I'm	O
looking	O
forward	O
to	O
resuming	O
a	O
more	O

lifestyle.	O
I	O
think	O
my	O
symptoms	O
are	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
Lipitor.	O

A	O
good	O
side	O
effect	O
-	O
I	O
take	O
the	O

taken	O
at	O

right	O
away	O
I	O
was	O

Approximately	O
4	O

159,	O
which	O
was	O
great,	O
BUT	O
I	O
started	O
having	O
terrible	O
aching	O
pain	O
in	O
my	O
arms	O
about	O
that	O
time	O
which	O
was	O
radiating	O
down	O
my	O
arms	O
from	O
my	O
shoulder	O
to	O
my	O
hands	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
sleep	O
well	O
at	O
all.	O
I	O
lost	O
all	O
the	O
strength	O
in	O
my	O
muscles	O
and	O
was	O
fatigued	O
all	O
the	O
time.	O
I	O
was	O
blaming	O
my	O
arthritis	O
for	O
my	O
pain	O
for	O
months	O
and	O
months.	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
extra	O
Relefen	O
and	O
Prednisone	O
which	O
helped	O
only	O
temporarly.	O
I	O
could	O
hardly	O
lift	O
a	O
glass	O
of	O
milk	O
without	O
using	O
both	O
hands,	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
weak	O
in	O
my	O
arms	O
and	O
hands.	O
One	O
day	O
it	O
just	O
hit	O
me.	O
Maybe	O
it's	O
the	O
Lipitor	O
.	O
It	O
was	O
the	O
newest	O
drug	O
I	O
was	O
taking.	O
So,	O
I	O
just	O
quit	O
taking	O
it	O
and	O
within	O
3	O
days	O
my	O
arm.	O
I	O
suggest	O
anyone	O
who	O
develops	O
a	O
bad	O
symption	O
within	O
a	O
week	O
or	O
month	O
of	O
going	O
on	O
Lipitor,	O
or	O
any	O
other	O
statin	O
drug,	O
quit	O
taking	O
it	O
and	O
call	O
your	O
doctor.	O
There	O
are	O
some	O
important	O
reasons	O
why	O
some	O
people	O
HAVE	O
to	O
be	O
on	O
a	O
statin	O
in	O
some	O
cases.	O

None	O
identified.	O
Currently	O
taking	O
20	O
mg/day.	O
Has	O
reduced	O
LDL	O
and	O
total	O
cholesterol	O
effectively	O
(latter	O
to	O
ca.	O
100),	O
but	O
HDL	O
is	O
still	O
low.	O

Back	O
pain,	O
Lipitor	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
involved.	O
In	O
November	O
of	O
2005	O
I	O
was	O
prescribed	O
Lipitor	O
for	O
elevated	O
cholesterol.	O
Not	O
really	O
high,	O
but	O
high	O
enough,	O
dosage	O
was	O
only	O
20	O
mg	O
per	O
day.	O
Within	O
two	O
months,	O
I	O
had	O
developed	O
wicked	O
back	O
pain,	O
along	O
with	O
neuropathy	O
and	O
hypersensitivity	O
that	O
wrapped	O
around	O
my	O
abdomen.	O
We	O
suspected	O
the	O
Lipitor	O
was	O
involved,	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
off	O
it,	O
since	O
my	O
numbers	O
had	O
gotten	O
really	O
low.	O
I	O
was	O
effectively	O
laid	O
up	O
for	O
about	O
six	O
months.	O
Since	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
immediate	O
improvement,	O
we	O
surmised	O
that	O
Lipitor	O
wasn't	O
causing	O
this.	O
It's	O
October	O
2006	O
now,	O
and	O
I'm	O
starting	O
to	O
feel	O
more	O
like	O
myself,	O
still	O
hurts	O
but	O
I	O
can	O
work	O
around	O
it.	O
The	O
cholesterol	O
has	O
crept	O
up,	O
so	O
two	O
weeks	O
ago	O
we	O
started	O
the	O
Lipitor	O
again,	O
and	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
I	O
was	O
paractically	O
flat	O
on	O
my	O
back	O
again!	O
So,	O
I've	O
stopped	O
again.	O
It's	O
a	O
bloody	O
shame	O
this	O
is	O
happening,	O
as	O
the	O
drug	O
was	O
extremely	O
effective	O
in	O
dropping	O
that	O
cholesterol.	O
Too	O
bad,	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
try	O
something	O
else,	O
I	O
guess.	O

Tingling	O
all	O
over	O
my	O
body	O
and	O
numbness.	O

Terrible	O
pain	O
in	O
hips	O
and	O
shoulders.	O
After	O
taking	O
Lipitor	O
for	O
a	O
year,	O
I	O
started	O
having	O
pain	O
in	O
my	O
hip.	O
Told	O
Dr	O
about	O
it,	O
he	O
didn't	O
seem	O
to	O
concerned.	O
After	O
about	O
1	O
1/2	O
years	O
I	O
started	O
having	O
pain	O
in	O
my	O
shoulders.	O
The	O
pain	O
is	O
so	O
bad	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
that	O
it	O
wakes	O
me	O
up	O
at	O
night	O
and	O
extremely	O
limits	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
my	O
arms.	O
Dr	O
sent	O
me	O
for	O
x-rays,	O
MRI,	O
to	O
see	O
an	O
orthopedic	O
surgeon.	O
All	O
results	O
negative.	O
They	O
suggested	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
tendonitis	O
or	O
avascular	O
necrosis	O
and	O
recommended	O
anti-inflammatories.	O
Nobody	O
ever	O
suggested	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
drug	O
until	O
I	O
found	O
this	O
site	O
doing	O
research	O
on	O
my	O
pain.	O
It	O
makes	O
me	O
wonder	O
how	O
powerful	O
these	O
drug	O
companies	O
are	O
that	O
doctors	O
won't	O
even	O
suggest	O
that	O
the	O
drug	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
problem.	O
I'm	O
stopping	O
this	O
drug	O
today	O
in	O
the	O
hopes	O
that	O
the	O
pain	O
goes	O
away.	O
Hopefully	O
I'll	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
play	O
catch	O
with	O
my	O
boys	O
and	O
swing	O
a	O
golf	O
club	O
again	O
some	O
day.	O
If	O
I	O
die	O
of	O
a	O
heart	O
attack	O
from	O
high	O
cholesteral	O
in	O
20	O
years,	O
so	O
be	O
it.	O
I'd	O
rather	O
have	O
a	O
shorter	O

that	O
I	O
enjoy	O
than	O
a	O

on	O
the	O

after	O
the	O

For	O

OH	O
your	O

you	O
are	O

That	O

this	O
was	O
the	O
last	O
shot	O
at	O
using	O
a	O
statin	O
to	O
reduce	O
cholesterol	O
ldl.	O
I	O
have	O
tried	O
all	O
the	O
statin	O
drugs,	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
very	O
expensive	O
drug	O
of	O
choice	O
for	O
all	O
the	O
doc's	O
out	O
there.	O
For	O
all	O
of	O
you	O
who	O
now	O
have	O
extremely	O
low	O
LDL	O
and	O
a	O
bad	O
case	O
of	O
joint	O
pain	O
to	O
the	O
extent	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
arthritic	O
or	O
having	O
bad	O
muscle	O
cramps	O
that	O
you	O
never	O
got	O
prior	O
to	O
the	O
drug,	O
it	O
is	O
from	O
the	O
statins.	O
The	O
drug	O
is	O
able	O
to	O
decrease	O
LDL	O
through	O
a	O
mechanism	O
which	O
also	O
destroys	O
and	O
depletes	O
your	O
bodies	O
ability	O
to	O
make	O
CoQ10.	O
This	O
is	O
necessary	O
for	O
they	O
health	O
of	O
muscles	O
and	O
joints	O
(that's	O
why	O
you	O
are	O
experiencing	O
the	O
joint	O
pains	O
and	O
numbness).	O
Remember	O
your	O
heart	O
is	O
a	O
muscle,	O
guess	O
what	O
is	O
happening	O
to	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
depletion	O
of	O
the	O
CoQ10???	O
If	O
you	O
do	O
some	O
research	O
on	O
the	O
internet,	O
you	O
will	O
find	O
that	O
all	O
these	O
statins	O
make	O
no	O
claims/nor	O
have	O
studies	O
shown	O
them	O
to	O
reduce	O
heart	O
attacks,	O
but	O
they	O
cause	O
muscle	O
problems	O
i.e.	O
your	O
heart,	O
this	O
is	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
they	O
put	O
younger	O
and	O
younger	O
people	O
on	O
these	O
drugs	O
and.	O
I	O
would	O
recommend	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
your	O
own	O
research	O
versus	O
just	O
listening	O
to	O
the	O
doctor	O
who	O
wants	O
your	O
LDL	O
down	O
to	O
like	O
below	O
130,	O
neurosurgeons,	O
who	O
have	O
studied	O
this	O
would	O
tell	O
you	O
not	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
all	O
too	O
low.	O
And	O
just	O
because	O
your	O
test	O
come	O
back	O
and	O
show	O
your	O
liver	O
functions	O
are	O
fine	O
and	O
don't	O
show	O
any	O
broken	O
down	O
muscle	O
toxins	O
in	O
the	O
blood	O
doesn't	O
mean	O
the	O
lack	O
of	O
CoQ10	O
isn't	O
breaking	O
down	O
and	O
damaging	O
your	O
muscles	O
very	O
slowly.	O
Mine	O
always	O
showed	O
fine	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
severe	O
arthritis	O
symptoms	O
in	O
knees	O
and	O
hip	O
joints	O
(never	O
had	O
this	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
before	O
statins)	O
and	O
bad	O
muscle	O
cramps	O
(also	O
never	O
got	O
those	O
until	O
statins).	O
Granted	O
is	O
you	O
have	O
high	O
blood	O
pressure,	O
high	O
LDL,	O
over	O
weight	O
and	O
maybe	O
smoke,	O
then	O
you	O
probably	O
need	O
something	O
to	O
lower	O
the	O
LDL,	O
if	O
you	O
only	O
have	O
high	O
LDL,	O
you	O
don't.	O
Read	O
the	O
drug	O
company	O
studies,	O
they	O
even	O
say	O
it	O
may	O
help	O
prevent	O
a	O
heart	O
attack	O
when	O
you	O
have	O
3	O
of	O
the	O
aforementioned	O
risk	O
factors.	O

Went	O
to	O
hospital	O
for	O
my	O
Tmj	O
pain	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
getting	O
out	O
of	O
control.	O
A	O
doctor	O
prescribed	O
me	O
this	O
to	O
take	O
two	O
a	O
day.	O
One	O
pill	O
and	O
20	O
minutes	O
later	O
the	O
worse	O
period	O

in	O
my	O
life.	O
After	O
half	O
an	O

it	O

its	O

a	O

a	O

i	O
still	O

after	O

random	O
shooting	O
lower	O
abdominal	O

I'm	O
scared	O
to	O

The	O
symptoms	O
got	O

worse	O
with	O
time.	O
They	O
included	O
fluid	O
retention,	O
all	O
over	O
muscle	O
pain,	O
cramps.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
them	O
a	O
week	O

and	O
felt	O
much	O
better	O
the	O
next	O
day.	O
Some	O
of	O
the	O
side	O

haven't	O
totally	O

but	O
I'm	O
improving	O
with	O
each	O
day.	O
My	O
doctor	O
doesn't	O
believe	O
that	O
this	O
medication	O
could	O
cause	O
this	O
reaction.	O

I	O
started	O
taking	O
Lipitor	O
in	O
December	O
2009	O
and	O
stopped	O
after	O
4	O
months.	O
During	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
experienced	O
extreme	O
pain	O
in	O
both	O
shoulders,	O
sometimes	O
in	O
the	O
neck	O
also,	O
causing	O
me	O
to	O
wake	O
several	O
times	O
each	O
night.	O
Pain	O
was	O
worse	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
but	O
rarely	O
went	O
away	O
completely	O
during	O
the	O
day.	O
Most	O
mornings	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
wash	O
my	O
hair	O
in	O
the	O
shower	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
unable	O
to	O
reach	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
my	O
head	O
with	O
my	O
hands.	O
Pain	O
and	O
restricted	O
movement	O
often	O
prevented	O
me	O
from	O
putting	O
on	O
shoes	O
and	O
socks	O
without	O
assistance.	O
In	O
January	O
this	O
year	O
I	O
started	O
experiencing	O
discomfort	O
in	O
my	O
left	O
hand	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time.	O
Now	O
in	O
both	O
hands,	O
the	O
pain	O
has	O
increased,	O
fingers	O
are	O
swollen	O
and	O
movement	O
is	O
restricted.	O
My	O
wife	O
tells	O
me	O
my	O
hands	O
are	O
warm	O
to	O
touch.	O
The	O
mornings	O
are	O
worse	O
when	O
they	O
hurt	O
the	O
most,	O
movement	O
is	O
restricted	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
fist.	O
Ice	O
and	O
ibruprofen	O
gel	O
help	O
but	O
only	O
for	O
a	O
short	O
while.	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
taking	O
400	O
mg	O
Ibruprofen	O
3	O
times	O
daily	O
for	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
weeks	O
on	O
my	O
doctors	O
advice	O
without.	O
This	O
drug	O
is	O
clearly	O
POISON	O
to	O
so	O
many	O
people	O
and	O
perhaps	O
there	O
is	O
good	O
reason	O
to	O
take	O
Pfizer	O
to	O
the	O
courts.	O
However	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
that	O
any	O
Doctor	O
prescribing	O
Lipitor	O
should	O
make	O
it	O
abundantly	O
clear	O
to	O
the	O
patient	O
that	O
very	O
serious	O
consequences	O
could	O
ensue	O
that	O
would	O
cause	O
extreme	O
pain	O
and	O
could	O
effect	O
quality	O
of	O
life.	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
failure	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
is	O
a	O
serious	O
deriliction	O
of	O
duty	O
that	O
should	O
be	O
tested	O
with	O
complaints	O
to	O
the	O
medical	O
authorities	O
that	O
oversee	O
our	O
doctors	O
and/or	O
the	O
courts.	O

worked	O
very	O
well;	O
it	O
took	O
about	O
a	O
month	O
for	O
noticeable	O
results,	O
but	O
the	O
relief	O
was	O
definite	O
and	O
lasting.	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
after	O
4-5	O
months	O
-	O
shoulder	O
remained	O
ok,	O
but	O
many	O
lesser	O
aches	O
and	O
pains	O
(back,	O
knees,	O
etc)	O
returned.	O
Clearly,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
systemic	O
effect	O
that	O
was	O
helpful	O
as	O
well.	O

Pain	O
along	O
front	O
and	O
outer	O
side	O
of	O
shins.	O
very	O
tender	O
to	O
the	O

walking	O
was	O
the	O
worst,some	O
weird	O

at	O
times.	O
lasted	O
for	O
years,	O
told	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
pinched	O
nerve	O
in	O
my	O
back.	O
After	O
reading	O
reports	O
on	O
the	O
internet	O
I	O
stopped	O
it	O
a	O
month	O
ago	O
and	O
its	O
about	O
50%	O
better	O
already.	O
muscle	O
pain	O
side	O
effects	O
seem	O
much	O
more	O
common	O
than	O
realized	O
by	O
doctors	O
or	O
admitted	O
by	O
the	O
company.	O

this	O
med	O
works	O
like	O
a	O
dream.	O
no	O
side	O
effects	O
and	O
it	O
does	O
its	O
job.	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
has	O
been	O
lowered	O
substantially.	O

None	O
that	O
I	O
have	O

My	O

I	O

Well	O
after	O
3	O

I	O
consulted	O

Make	O

All	O

after	O
two	O

to	O

Anyone	O
taking	O

should	O
be	O
taken	O
off	O

before	O
his	O

without	O

I	O
strongly	O
feel	O
the	O
lipitor	O
had	O
the	O
crucial	O
side	O
effect	O
upon	O
my	O

causing	O

there	O
is	O

therefore	O
i	O
put	O
my	O

on	O

which	O
at	O

avoided	O
the	O

General	O
fatigue,	O

and	O

for	O

Thought	O
it	O
was	O
menopause.	O
But	O
recently--severe	O
swolen/inflamation	O
of	O
the	O
fingers/hands	O
and	O
wrist	O
pain.	O
Have	O
suffered	O
with	O
geneal	O
aches	O
and	O
pains	O
for	O
years	O
thinking	O
very	O
similar	O
to	O
alot	O
of	O
you,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
my	O
age	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
accept	O
it!	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
suffering	O
with	O
severe	O
swolen/inflamation	O
of	O
the	O
fingers/hand	O
&	O
wrist	O
pain	O
for	O
8	O
months	O
and	O
attributed	O
it	O
to	O
new	O
blood	O
pressure	O
medicine	O
or	O
arthritis;	O
however,	O
after	O
going	O
off	O
the	O
new	O
blood	O
pressure	O
meds	O
for	O
5	O
weeks,	O
I	O
have	O
noticed	O
no	O
remarkable	O
change	O
and	O
have	O
had	O
blood	O
work	O
and	O
x-rays	O
indicating	O
NO	O
arthritis.	O
But	O
now	O
after	O
finding	O
this	O
site,	O
I'm	O
wondering	O
if	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
the	O
Lipitor	O
all	O
along	O
all	O
of	O
a	O
sudden	O
after	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
7.5	O
years.	O
I	O
am	O
discontinuing	O
the	O
Lipitor	O
immediately	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
I	O
can	O
find	O
any	O
change	O
and	O
relief.	O
I	O
agree	O
with	O
so	O
many	O
of	O
you	O
in	O
saying	O
that	O
no	O
cholesterol	O
lowering	O
drug	O
is	O
worth	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
result!	O
Thank	O
you	O
everyone	O
for	O
taking	O
the	O
time	O
to	O
write	O
so	O
we	O
aren't	O
prisoners	O
to	O
just	O
our	O
doctor's	O
advice!.	O

I	O
cannot	O
believe	O
the	O
immediate	O
difference	O
this	O
medication	O
had	O
made	O
in	O
my	O
life.	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
up	O
from	O
my	O
desk	O
without	O
holding	O
onto	O
the	O
desk	O
and	O
walking	O
up	O
the	O
stairs	O
was	O
intolerable.	O
Within	O
one	O
day	O
I	O
felt	O
the	O
pain	O
lessen.	O
I	O
am	O
now	O
walking	O
up	O
the	O
stairs	O
95	O
%	O
normal	O
and	O
can	O
actually	O
walk	O
through	O
a	O
mall	O
without	O
having	O
to	O
sit	O
down	O
every	O
5	O
minutes.	O
i	O
am	O
in	O
need	O
of	O
a	O
knee	O
replacement,	O
but	O
in	O

feel	O
like	O
I	O
have	O
my	O

back.	O

My	O

Went	O
off	O

Now,	O
I'm	O

it	O

until	O
I	O
ran	O
out	O
and	O
stopped	O

that	O
I	O
discovered	O
how	O

better	O
I	O

I	O
know	O
several	O
others	O
that	O
take	O
Lipitor	O

in	O

it	O
came	O
with	O
mild	O
side	O
effects	O
like	O
general	O
body	O
stiffness	O
and	O
muscle	O
pain.	O
I'll	O
ask	O
for	O
another	O
medicine.	O

My	O

I	O
walk	O
like	O
an	O

My	O
doctor	O
noticed	O
a	O
rough	O
sound	O
in	O
my	O

a	O

that	O
was	O
never	O

I'm	O

I	O
was	O
OK	O
taking	O
20mg	O
but	O
the	O
doctor	O
raised	O
me	O
to	O
40mg	O
about	O
4	O
months	O
ago.	O
It's	O
only	O
since	O
then	O
that	O
I've	O

I'll	O
probably	O
quit	O

I'm	O
not	O

anything	O

And	O
at	O
a	O

that	O
is	O
just	O
not	O

Extreme	O

my	O

My	O
entire	O

down.	O
My	O

the	O

in	O

left	O
us	O
floundering	O
on	O
our	O

going	O
from	O
one	O

to	O
counter	O
what	O

My	O
children	O
did	O
some	O

on	O
the	O

about	O
my	O
drugs	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
taking,	O
which	O
included	O

learned	O
about	O
the	O

to	O
this	O

and	O
I	O
stopped	O
Voltaren.	O
The	O
specialists	O
agreed	O
with	O
this	O
conclusion,	O
since	O
they	O
were	O
exact	O
to	O
my	O

My	O
body	O
reacted	O
and	O
I	O
recovered	O
gradually.	O
My	O
advice	O
to	O
all	O
-	O
STOP	O
-	O
Find	O
something	O
else.	O
I	O
lost	O
2	O
months	O
of	O
my	O

and	O
I	O
still	O
don't	O
remember	O
the	O
entire	O
e.	O
If	O
you	O
are	O
taking	O
this	O

-	O
Make	O
absolutely	O

that	O
you	O
get	O

done	O
every	O
6	O
months,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
catch	O
any	O

Then	O
-	O
STOP	O
-	O
the	O
drug.	O

my	O
legs	O

started	O

I	O

I	O
wasn't	O
noticing	O

before,	O

this	O
may	O
be	O
due	O
to	O

I'm	O
now	O
in	O

I've	O
started	O

Some	O

that	O
I	O

that	O
I	O
noticed	O
some	O
of	O
you	O

Is	O
it	O
because	O

the	O

to	O

because	O

I	O
was	O

After	O

NOTHING	O

I	O
am	O

which	O
is	O

I'm	O
afraid	O
that	O
the	O
drug	O
is	O
masking	O
the	O

which	O
enables	O
me	O
to	O
overexert	O
my	O

This	O
really	O

I	O

why?	O
I	O

spent	O
4	O

in	O

am	O
calling	O
my	O

and	O
getting	O
off	O
this	O

immediately!!!!	O
Even	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
culprit,	O
I	O

which	O
I	O
suspect	O
is	O
due	O
to	O
Lipitor.	O
Started	O
on	O
20mg	O
and	O
progressed	O
to	O
80mg.	O

just	O
took	O
the	O

about	O
30	O

combined.	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
keep	O
dropping	O
into	O
a	O

due	O
to	O
the	O
severity	O
of	O
the	O
lower	O
abdominal	O
pain.	O
i	O
was	O
put	O
on	O
this	O
medication	O
because	O
i	O
was	O
taking	O
such	O
high	O

of	O
Advil	O
to	O
quell	O
the	O
inflammation	O
in	O
my	O

all	O
the	O
chemicals.	O
I	O
am	O
fed	O
up	O
with	O
all	O
those	O
medications	O
which	O
ALL	O
induce	O
side	O
effects,	O
for	O
which	O
your	O
doctor	O
will	O
prescribe	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
medications.	O
That	O
is	O
when	O
hell	O
starts.	O
My	O
hair	O
was	O
falling	O
off,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
lose	O
weight	O
even	O
exercising	O
and	O
eating	O
healthy	O
food.	O
When	O
I	O
stopped	O
Lipitor,	O
my	O
hair	O
stopped	O
falling	O
immediately	O
and	O
I	O
lost	O
4	O
lbs	O
the	O
1st	O
week,	O
without	O
doing	O
anything	O
different.	O
You	O
completely	O
destroy	O
your	O
metabolism	O
absorbing	O
chemicals.	O
Now	O
I	O
stopped	O
all	O
that	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
going	O
the	O
NATURAL	O
way	O
with	O
good	O
results.	O
I	O
recommend	O
acupuncture,	O
homeopathy,	O
natural	O
supplements	O
(I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
Apple	O
Cider	O
Vinegar	O
and	O
raw	O
honey,	O
those	O
made	O
my	O
blood	O
pressure	O
go	O
down	O
by	O
30	O
points!),	O
good	O
nutrition	O
and	O
exercise	O
are	O
much	O
better	O
and	O
you	O
will	O
not	O
enrich	O
those	O
pharmaceutical	O
companies	O
which	O
are	O
after	O
your	O
money,	O
just	O
trying	O
to	O
erase	O
the	O
symptoms	O
but	O
NOT	O
the	O
cause.	O
Take	O
charge!	O
It	O
is	O
time.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
same	O
poster	O
as	O
the	O
previous	O
posting.	O
I	O
notice	O
a	O
poster	O
attributed	O
Bell's	O
palsy	O
to	O
lipitor.	O
I	O
too	O
had	O
Bell's,	O
I	O
went	O
back	O
and	O
looked	O
at	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
chart	O
and	O
found	O
I	O
got	O
Bell's	O
before	O
I	O
started	O
on	O
lipitor.	O
There	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
consistent	O
occurence	O
of	O
muscle	O
pain	O
and/or	O
liver	O
problems	O
but	O
I	O
wonder	O
how	O
many	O
other	O
problems	O
are	O
not	O
really	O
attributable	O
to	O
lipitor	O
eg	O
see	O
my	O
Bell's	O
palsy.	O
Also	O
I	O
get	O
night	O
muscle	O
cramps	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
occasional	O
muscle	O
cramps	O
at	O
night	O
since	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
child,	O
Maybe	O
my	O
memory	O
isn't	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
I'm	O
70	O
and	O
I	O
still	O
passed	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
hardest	O
bar	O
exams	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
less	O
than	O
2	O
years	O
ago.	O
However	O
I	O
don't	O
doubt	O
that	O
some	O
unlucky	O
people	O
are	O
having	O
bad	O
side	O
effects,	O
I	O
just	O
wonder	O
about	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
more	O
esoteric	O
ones.	O

Definitely	O
short	O
term	O
memory	O
issues,	O
but	O
I'm	O
44	O
and	O
I	O
suppose	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
part	O
of	O
menopause	O
on	O
its	O
way.	O
lowered	O
overall	O
cholesterol	O
and	O
my	O
hdl	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
59	O
from	O
35,	O
and	O
triglycerides	O
went	O
down	O
but	O
not	O
enough.	O
LDL	O
down	O
too	O
but	O
not	O
enough	O
so	O
taking	O
higher	O
dose	O
now.	O
Worked	O
like	O
a	O
champ	O
at	O
10	O
mg	O
for	O
first	O
two	O
years.	O
Now	O
switched	O
from	O
GP	O
to	O
cardiologist	O
and	O
he's	O
upped	O
it	O
to	O
40	O
mg	O
so	O
will	O
see.	O
have	O
only	O
taken	O
3	O
tablets	O
since	O
new	O
dosage.	O

Still	O
have	O

in	O

if	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
take	O
it,	O
with	O

Took	O
Liptor	O
for	O
3	O
months	O
2	O
years	O
ago.	O
Developed	O
severe	O
thigh	O
muscle	O
pain	O
(both	O
legs	O
involved)	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
walk	O
75	O
feet.	O
Took	O
myself	O
off	O
Liptor	O
and	O
all	O
symtoms	O
went	O
completely	O
away.	O
Then	O
my	O
doctor	O
had	O
a	O
bright	O
idea	O
to	O
try	O
Liptor	O
again	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
symtoms	O
came	O
back.	O
Problem	O
is,	O
went	O
off	O
this	O
drug	O
and	O
I	O
still	O
have	O
muscle	O
problem	O
and	O
at	O
times	O
can	O
hardly	O
walk!	O
Now	O
the	O
top	O
outer	O
thigh	O
muscle	O
starts	O
to	O
feel	O
very	O
warm,	O
then	O
get	O
numb	O
and	O
lastly	O
it	O
starts	O
to	O
feel	O
very	O
cool	O
(Like	O
the	O
icy	O
hot	O
patch).	O
This	O
drug	O
is	O
so	O
bad,	O
I	O
just	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
back	O
to	O
my	O
normal	O
self,	O
but	O
I	O
feel	O
that	O
the	O
damage	O
has	O
been	O
done!	O
Am	O
making	O

appointment	O
to	O

anything	O

be	O
done.	O
2-3	O
month.	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
experience	O
any,	O
but	O
only	O
took	O
1	O
tab	O
once	O
a	O
day	O
for	O
two	O
days.	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
Voltaren	O
took	O
away	O
all	O
my	O
pain,	O
i	O
rarely	O
use	O
pain	O
relief	O
because	O
i	O
find	O
it	O
never	O
helps	O
or	O
takes	O
too	O
long	O
to	O
take	O

and	O
just	O
"""soldier"	O

As	O

HOWEVER	O
my	O

both	O

will	O
cut	O
it	O
just	O
take	O
one	O

them.	O
the	O
chances	O
of	O
getting	O
side	O

seem	O
to	O
increase	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
length	O
of	O
time	O
you	O
continue	O
using	O
them	O
(like	O
most	O
drugs)	O
and	O
the	O
effectiveness	O
of	O
the	O
pain	O

can	O
also	O

Lipitor	O
to	O
40mg	O

80mg.	O
The	O
last	O

have	O
been	O
a	O
physical	O
and	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
stopped	O

immediately	O
felt	O

Statins	O
destroyed	O
my	O
life,	O
I	O
am	O
certain	O

became	O
more	O
anxious	O
about	O
EVERYTHING,	O
and	O
noticed	O
words	O
would	O
not	O
form	O
in	O
my	O

during	O

was	O
disturbing	O
and	O
couldn't	O
figure	O
out	O
why	O
these	O
things	O
were	O
happening.	O
made	O
me	O
think	O
i	O
needed	O
antidepressants	O
or	O
something	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
constant	O
anxiety/fear	O
(which	O
i	O
have	O
taken	O
before	O
and	O
are	O
horrible	O
to	O
get	O
off	O
of)	O
have	O
noticed	O
slightly	O
more	O
tingling	O
and	O
weird	O
pains,	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
perfect	O
time	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
this.	O
I	O
agree	O
with	O
another	O
post.	O
what	O
are	O
they	O
doing	O
to	O
us,	O
in	O
the	O
interest	O
of	O
healing	O
us?	O
I	O
did	O
take	O
the	O
actual	O
lipitor	O
for	O
several	O
yrs,	O
and	O
it	O
did	O
lower	O
cholesteral,	O
but	O
started	O
experiencing	O
the	O
muscle	O
tingley	O
thing	O
and	O
stopped	O
,	O
then	O
started	O
with	O
the	O
Atorvastatin,	O
where	O
i	O
noticed	O
the	O
above	O
side	O
affects.	O
be	O
very	O
aware	O
of	O
any	O
physical/emotional	O
changes.	O

Just	O
before	O
this	O
last	O
Christmas	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
small	O
stroke	O
and	O
spent	O
three	O
days	O
in	O
the	O
hospital.	O
To	O
make	O
a	O
long	O
story	O
short,	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
after	O
effects	O
of	O
the	O
stroke.	O
In	O
other	O
words	O
the	O
symptoms	O
went	O
away.	O
But,	O
my	O
Doc	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
Aggrenox	O
and	O
20mg	O
of	O
Lipitor.	O
I	O
have	O
very	O
high	O
arches	O
and	O
have	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
tingling	O
in	O
my	O
feet	O
for	O
years.	O
This	O
is	O
really	O
helped	O
with	O
a	O
good	O
arch	O
support.	O
But	O
for	O
the	O
last	O
two	O
months	O
the	O
pain	O
in	O
my	O
feet	O
and	O
calves	O
(and	O
sometimes	O
thigh)	O
has	O
gotten	O
much	O
worse.	O
I	O
cannot	O
walk	O
very	O
far	O
and	O
sleeping	O
has	O
become	O
a	O
problem	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
pain.	O
Because	O
of	O
the	O
preexisting	O
arch	O
problem,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
naturally	O
getting	O
worse	O
but	O
after	O
finding	O
this	O
web	O
site	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
Lipitor.	O
On	O
a	O
pain	O
scale	O
it	O
has	O
gone	O
from	O
a	O
1	O
or	O
2	O
to	O
7	O
or	O
8.	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
followup	O
apointment	O
with	O
my	O
Doctor	O
in	O
two	O
days	O
and	O
was	O

him	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
go	O
off	O
the	O
